"In mathematics, a function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y. The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function. Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another"

"\n\nSo f(x) shows us the function is called \"f\", and \"x\" goes in and we usually see what a function does with the input: f(x) = x2 shows us that function \"f\" takes \"x\" and squares it."

"\n\nExample: with f(x) = x2 :"

"n\nAn input of 4 becomes an output of 16."

"\n\nIn fact we can write f(4) = 16."

"\n\nThe \"x\" is Just a Place-Holder!"

"\n\nDon't get too concerned about \"x\", it is just there to show us where the input goes and what happens to it."

"\n\nIt could be anything!"

"\n\nSo this function: f(x) = 1 - x + x2"

"\n\nIs the same function as: "

"\n\nf(q) = 1 - q + q2"
"\nh(A) = 1 - A + A2"
"\nw(?) = 1 - ? + ?2\n\n"<<endl;
