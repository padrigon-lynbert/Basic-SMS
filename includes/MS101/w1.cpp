cout<<"4.1. Elements and Properties of Sets"
"\n\nWhat are the elements of a set or members of a set?"

"\n\nThe objects used to form a set are called its element or its members. Generally, the elements of a set are written inside a pair of curly (idle) braces and are represented by commas. The name of the set is always written in capital letter."

"\n\n\nWhat are the two basic properties of sets?"

"\n\n1. The change in order of writing the elements does not make any changes in the set. "

"\n\nIn other words the order in which the elements of a set are written is not important. Thus, the set {a, b, c} can also be written as {a, c, b} or {b, c, a} or {b, a, c} or {c, a, b} or {c, b, a}. "

"\n\n2. If one or many elements of a set are repeated, the set remains the same. "

"\n\nIn other words the elements of a set should be distinct. So, if any element of a set is repeated number of times in the set, we consider it as a single element. Thus, {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4} The set of letters in the word 'GOOGLE' = {G, O, L, E}"

"\n\n\n4.3 Venn Diagram What are Venn Diagrams?"
"\n\nPictorial representations of sets represented by closed figures are called set diagrams or Venn diagrams. Venn diagrams are used to illustrate various operations like union, intersection and difference. We can express the relationship among sets through this in a more significant way.\n\n"<<endl;
