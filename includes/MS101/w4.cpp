cout<<"4.1. Cardinality: Cardinal Number of a set"

"\n\nThe number of distinct elements or members in a finite set is known as the cardinal number of a set. Basically, through cardinality, we define the size of a set. The cardinal number of a set A is denoted as n(A), where A is any set and n(A) is the number of members in set A."

"\n\nConsider a set A consisting of the prime numbers less than 10."

"\n\nSet A ={2, 3, 5, 7}. "

"\n\nAs the set A consists of 4 elements, therefore, the cardinal number of set A is given as n(A) = 4. "

"\n\nProperties related to difference, union and intersection and the cardinal number of set "

"\n\ni) Union of Disjoint Sets: "

"\n\nIf A and B are two finite sets and if A ∩ B = ∅, then "

"\n\nn(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) "

"\n\nIn simple words if A and B are finite sets and these sets are disjoint then the cardinal number of Union of sets A and B is equal to the sum of the cardinal number of set A and set B."


"\n\n\nii) Union of two sets: "

"\n\nIf A and B are two finite sets, then "

"\n\nn(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) – n(A ∩ B)"


"\n\n\niii) Union of three sets "

"\n\nIf A, B and C are three finite sets, then; "

"\n\nn(A ∪ B ∪ C) = n(A) + n(B) + n(C) – n(A ∩ B) – n(B ∩ C) – n(A ∩ C) + n(A ∩ B ∩ C)\n\n"<<endl;
