cout<<"\n\n4.1. Propositions"
"\nWe know what sentences are (I hope):"

"\n\nJohn is going to the store. "
"\nThat guy is going to the store. "
"\nJohn, go to the store. "
"\n\nDid John go to the store?"

"\n\n\nDeclarative sentences are propositions."

"\n\ni.e. Sentences that assert a fact that could either be true or false. "

"\n\ni.e. Something you could make into a question with \"对不对.\""

"\n\nOf the above, only (1) is a proposition as it is: we need all the details. "
"\n\n(2) would be a proposition if we knew who \"that guy\" is."

"\n\nNot all sentences are propositions "



"\n\nAbove, (3) is a command: it's not true or false. "
"\n(4) is a question, so definitely not a statement."

"\n\nOf course, this has something to do with mathematics. "

"\n\nThere are statements in math like \"10−4=6\" and \"1+1=3\"."

"\n\nOne of those is true and one is false, but they are both propositions. (If you don't know which is which, you're in trouble.)"
"\n\nOf course math has variables."

"\n\nIn our propositions, they will be like \"that guy\" in the above examples. "


"\n\nif we know their value, we can decide if the proposition is true or false. o e.g. x+7=3x+y=0 "


"\n\nIn those examples, x and y probably stand for numbers. "
"\n\nWe also need variables to represent propositions: propositional variables. "
"\n\nTypically use letters p,q,r,s,… for propositional variables. "
"\n\ne.g. For a proposition p, we can ask if p is true or false."
"\n\nWhen writing math, we'll write T and F instead true and false."
"\n\nWhat we're studying now is propositional logic: the study of these propositions and how they can be logically combined.\n\n"<<endl;
