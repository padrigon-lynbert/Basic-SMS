"\n\nWhat is Relation on Set?"

       "\n\nLet X be a set. A (binary) Relation on X is a subset R⊆X×X where X×X is defined to be the The Cartesian Product of Set X with itself. If (x,y)∈R we write xRy which means \"x relates y\" and if (x,y)∉R we write xR y which means \"x does not relate y\"."

       "\n\nIn general if X and Y are sets then a binary relation between X and Y is a subset R⊆X×Y. We will mostly be looking deeply into relations where X=Y, i.e., relations on various sets to themselves. Consider the set A of positive integers from 1 to 10 inclusive: Example 1:"

"\n\nA={1,2,...,10} "

"\n\nThe strict inequality < is a relation R on X×X where the pairs (x,y)∈R⊆X×X are such that the numerical value of x is strictly less than the numerical value of y, that is x"

"\n\nConsider a set X of all subsets of E={x,y,z}. Then the containment ⊆ is a relation R on X×X where the pairs (A,B)∈R⊆X×X are such that A is a subset of B, that is A⊂B.\n\n"<<endl;
