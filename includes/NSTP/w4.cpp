"\n\nWhat is Social Mobilization?"

"\n\nMckee (1992) defined social mobilization is the process of bringing together all visible and practical inter-sectoral and social allies to raise people's awareness of the demand for a particular development program to assist in the delivery of resources and services and to strengthen community participation for sustainability and self-reliance."

"\n\nIn other words social mobilization is the creation of a vast social movement for a particular program"

"\n\nsocial mobilization is different from social marketing because it is wider in scope"
"\nsocial mobilization is not only limited to the use of commercial marketing principles and strategies in effecting social change."

"\n\nAspect of social mobilization is further supported by the four aims of social mobilization by the UNICEF or the United Nations international children's of mine is cited by McKee in 1992. "

"\n\nto increase people's awareness knowledge and the ability to organize her self-reliance;"
"\nto help people to be motivated and to know about the rights and duties and to begin to demand satisfaction of their needs;"
"\nto understand and modify people's ideas and beliefs; and"
"\nto mobilize all available resources"


"\n\n\nCharacteristics of social mobilization"

"\n\n1. a self-sustaining process;"

"\n\n2. a multi-level approach that is both bottom-up and top-down;"

"\n\n3. based on an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of a country social cultural and political economic contexts;"

"\n\n4. carefully planned and or visibility so as to ensure that demand created in the mobilizing process is met;"

"\n\n5.  intensified programming at selected pressure points;"

"\n\n6. a dynamic process requiring a fast-moving support response."


"\n\n\nFive Approaches of Social Mobilization"

"\n\n1. political"
"\n2. government"
"\n3. community"
"\n4. corporate; and"
"\n5. beneficiary"

"\n\nWhat is the role of social marketing and social mobilization?"

"\n\nSocial marketing is an approach that is applied to social mobilization who especially in creating demand for development programs ideas products and services likewise social marketing techniques are used in social"

"\n\nmobilization to spur stakeholders to action social marketing is needed in social mobilization in the aspect of"

"\n\ndesigning positioning advertising and making stakeholders by the social idea our product introduced by a development program with social mobilization and technical component."


"\n\n\nWhat is mass mobilization?"

"\n\nIt is also known as social mobilization or popular mobilization"

"\n\nIt refers to mobilization of civilian population as part of contentious politics"

"\n\nIt can be used by social movements, including revolutionary movements, but also by the state itself"

"\n\nIt commonly manifests itself in the form of large public gatherings such as mass meetings, parades or demonstrations which usually serve as a form of protest action"


"\n\nTraditional mass mobilization occurs within local communities to which individuals have longstanding commitments, such as peasant villages or urban craft guilds. News of political change are common triggers for such mobilization, which aim is to call attention to economic distresses of the community. Peasant rebellions are an example of such an occurrence."

"\n\nInformal mass mobilization occurs when individuals’ decisions to engage in protest actions are made through loosely connected networks based on personal mend ship, shared workplace, and neighborhood. Increasingly modern technology, such mobile phones or the Internet, is used to generate informal mass mobilization. This generally occurs in response to a crisis; neighborhoods or friends then mobilize themselves to take unconventional actions. Demonstrations such as the Monday demonstrations in GDR or those during Iranian revolution are examples,"

"\n\nThe extent to which mass mobilization is organized versus spontaneous and the extent to which it reties on reason versus emotions are still debated by scholars."

"\n\nAnother term for mass mobilization is grassroots lobbying. This refers to the average citizen contacting their legislator to persuade them about an issue."

"\n\nSocial Mobilization, as defined by UNICEF, is a broad scale movement to engage people's participations in achieving specific development goal through self-reliant effort. It involves all relevant segments of society: decision and policy makers, opinion leaders, bureaucrats and technocrats, professional groups, religious associations, commerce and industry, communities and individuals. It is a planned decentralized process that seeks to facilitate change for development through range of players engaged in interrelated and complementary efforts. It takes into account the felt needs of the people, embraces 'the critical principle of community •involvement, seeks to empower individuals and groups for action."

"\n\nMobilizing the necessary resources, disseminating information tailored to targeted audiences, generating inter sectoral support and fostering cToss-professiona1 alliances are also part of the process. While the components of the process may be everyday practice -in many development programs, they tend to be taken up in isolation of each other."

"\n\nSocial mobilization in total aims at a continuum of activities in a broad strategic framework. The process compasses dialogue and partnership with a wide spectrum of societal elements. At the policy level; the outcomes should be a supportive framework for decision making and resource allocation to empower communities to act at the grassroots level. The outcomes should be people’s active involvement ranging from identifying a need to implementation in achieving the development objective and evaluation effort. The solidarity of bureaucrats and technocrats and broad alliance of partners among various nongovernmental groups are equally critical for the attainment of any change-oriented development goal. Simply stated, social mobilization calls for journey among partners and results in the successful transformation of development goals into societal action."


"\n\nThough circumstances diner from country to country and often from one pare or a country to another, health programs depend upon collaboration of other sectors. WHO has stressed the need to recognize the intersectoral nature of health, but little concrete action has been taken to effectuate such an approach. For 3 health program to succeed, the health sector needs not lust a helping hand from others, but a genuine partnership whereby ownership of sectors the programs are clearly is snared calls recognized. For and partnership the stakes of other sectors are clearly recognized. The societal mobilization strategy calls for partnership with all stake holders, which are illustrated in the diagram;"


"\n\n\nI. Political – policy makers"

"\n\nThe extreme left column names some types of policy makers. Advocacy with and among leaders in this group helps roster me commitment that win clear the way for action. The goal here is build consensus with sound data, to create a knowledgeable and supportive environment for decision-making, including the allocation of adequate resources."

"\n\nII. Bureaucratic/Technocratic – government workers and technical experts"
"\nPolicy makers depend on the technocrats, bureaucrats, end service professionals to provide the rationale for decisions as well as to plan and implement programs. This sector includes disparate groups, each with its own agenda, conflicting interests and concerns. Harmonizing the disparate units in this sector is probably one of the greatest challenges in development, because development specialists have hitherto failed to recognize how difficult is to foster unity among government units and technical groups."

"\n\nIII. Non-governmental sector"
"\nThis covers a multitude of interests. Non-governmental organizations for special purposes, social institutions and associations that represent organized support, religious groups with their ideological bends, commerce and industry that operate on a for profit basis, and professional groups that exist to advance their interests are here. Though difficult to mobilize, they do not hide their positions. If their stakes are given recognition, they are important partners and allies to mobilize the civil society for various health objectives."

"\n\nIV. Community Groups"
"\nCommunity leaders, schools, churches, mosques and grassroots groups are critical to get communities involved, they help transform development goals into action. Unfortunately, they are often not given a voice in identifying problems and designing solutions. Popular participation takes place here."

"\n\nV. Households and Individuals"
"\nIndividual actions are the ultimate pay-off of the health program. In the household, where such behavioral actions take place, key individuals in traditional society often hold sway. There needs to be deliberate action to inform and educate individuals in the, household so they could make informed choices.\n\n"<<endl;
