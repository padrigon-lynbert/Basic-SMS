"\n\n\nBrief History of HRDP-COPAR"

	"\n\n\tPhilippine Center for Population and Development (PCPD) saw the potentials of health academic institution’s faculty and students, staff of private clinics and hospitals as manpower resources for undeserved depressed communities."
	
	"\n\n\tPCPD launched a five-year (1985-1990) Health Resources Distribution Program (HRPD I). The program was geared towards the distribution of health manpower resources from urban to rural areas. Three nursing schools, two medical colleges, two private hospitals and urban church-based clinic had institutionalized outreach programs that provided for developing community-based primary health care programs in 36 communities."
	
	"\n\n\tTo make Health Resource Distribution Program maw efficient and effective, health resources  “distribution” became “development” of health services but improving the capabilities of the health manpower. This gave rise to the Health Resource Development Program (HRDP II)"
	
	"\n\n\tOn September 19, 1991, the PCPD launched HRDP, with the aim to develop effective primary health care system towards self-reliance in heath. Faculty and students were tapped as facilitator of health and development."
	
	"\n\n\tOn 1992, HRDP employed Community Organizing (CO) reaching out to the communities and the Participatory Action Research (PAR) was adopted."
