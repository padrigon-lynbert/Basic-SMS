"\n\nELECTION PROCESS IN THE PHILIPPINES"

"\n\nThe Philippines is a functioning democracy, though popular protests have forced out two presidents in almost more than 20 years: first, Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 for alleged electoral manipulation and second, Joseph Estrada in 2001 for allegedly plundering the economy. The country’s politics has continued to be characterized by volatility. The Philippines is still grappling with Muslim separatists, predominantly those of the island of Mindanao. In addition, the current president, Gloria Macapagal-arroyo, won a contentious election in 2004 and is now facing an electoral scandal, after a phone call between her and an election official, taped before the election had concluded, turned up. President Arroyo has denied she made any attempt to influence the vote."


"\n\n\nThe following are the important features of the first Philippine automated election"

"\n\nCANDIDATE NAMES ARE FILLED PRE-FILLED IN THE BALLOT: Instead of the writing the name of the candidate, the oval beside the name is fully-marked."

"\n\nThe counting process is quick."

"\n\nThe generation of the ER is automatic upon the close of elections; produces 30 copies."

"\n\nThe canvassing process is transparent, auditable… with NO-HUMAN INTERVENTION."

"\n\nThe transmission of data is fast."

"\n\nWithin 36 hours after the voting Filipinos will know who will be the next president of the Philippines."

 
"\n\n\nDiscussion on the Philippine Automated Elections"

"\n\nThe conduct of elections in the Philippines for the past four decades has remained largely unchanged. Philippine elections rely heavily on manual tallying and canvassing of votes thus making them vulnerable to control and manipulation by traditional politicians and those with vested interests."

"\n\nThe cost of winning an elective post is highly expensive, and the absence of mechanisms to check and limit sources of campaign funds to become fertile grounds for corruption and divisiveness."

"\n\nThe following have been identified as basic problems afflicting the electoral system:"

"\n\na. outdated electoral  process"
"\nb. failure to implement the electoral modernization law;"
"\nc. limited administrative and regulatory capabilities of COMELEC"
"\nd. ineffective educational/information campaigns  on new laws and policies"
"\ne.  weak political party system"
"\nf. un accountable political financings"
"\ng. defective party list system (Governance  Assessment, 2003)"


"\n\n\nII. Goals, Strategies and Action Plans"

"\n\nTo ensure a credible and transparent electoral process, the modernization of the electoral system through computerization shall be supported to ensure the credibility of polls and correct the deficiencies in the electoral system.  Likewise, the Omnibus Election Code shall be further revised and amended to respond to the needs of the present electoral system."


"\n\n\nCommon Types of Election"

"\n\n1. Presidential election-is the election of any head of state whose official title is president."

"\n\n2. General election-is an election in which all or most members of a given political body are up for election. The term is usually used to refer to elections held for a nation’s primary legislative body, as distinguished from by-elections and local elections."

"\n\n3. Primary election-is an election in which voters in a jurisdiction select candidates for a subsequent"

"\n\n4. By-election-is a decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold formal office."

"\n\n5. Local election"

"\n\n6. Co-option-is an election where members of a committee (or similar group) vote in order to fill a vacancy on that committee or group."

"\n\n7. Referendum-(plural referendums or referenda) is a democratic tool related to elections in which the electorate votes for or against a specific proposal, law or policy rather than for a general or a particular candidate or party.\n\n"<<endl;
