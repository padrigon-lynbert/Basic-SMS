"\n\nTo understand fully the lesson for today, read the information comprehensively."

"\n\nDYNAMIC LEARNING FRAMEWORK"

"\n\nTechnology is not a magic Solution for education, but it is an Opportunity! An opportunity to do things differently.   To deepen, the learning to engage students in new ways, and an opportunity for dynamic learning."

"\n\nDynamic learning is characterized by constant change and activity. This learning takes place organically, growing and evolving through more unconventional means, with the learner collaborating, creating, and communicating to demonstrate progress and mastery."


"\n\n\nThere are five learning characteristics in this framework"

"\n\nBeyond the bell, Learning doesn’t have to end when the bell rings, use digital tools and devices that are available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, students can continue to learn, collaborate, grow and dig deeper into their learning on their own terms and by extending learning beyond the school day, I don’t need homework. This is a mindset based on the belief that learning can take place on anytime and anywhere."

"\n\nBeyond the grade level and subject area the education system we have today is based on the fact we model in which students are placed on a conveyor belt. What they learn, is what fits inside the factory box all dictated by their ages and grade levels. Let’s take kids off the conveyor belt of education and give them opportunities to move beyond the subject areas we teach, allowing students to explore their own passions and interests, learning doesn’t have to fit inside a box."

"\n\nBeyond the walls, bring your students to the world and bring the world to your students. Every student in every grade should have the opportunity to publish their work for a global audience the moment they get their first comment, a shift happens! Students suddenly care much more about the quality of their work, now with that around bring the outside world into your class room through global collaboration, social media, virtual field trips, video chats, and more. The possibilities are endless."

"\n\nBeyond the tools, think beyond using digital tools to complete only traditional assignments such as papers and reports, use digital tools to do new things. Just doing paperless or digital isn’t enough, use some of these new tools to go further, go deeper, and extend your student’s learning, reach beyond what you think a digital tool can do and should be used for and challenge your students to demonstrate their learning In a new way."

"\n\nBeyond the due date, allow students to continue work and interest them beyond the final assessment of an assignment or task. Thinking, learning, and exploring shouldn’t be cycled simply because the submission deadline arrives, moving toward more dynamic learning experiences means moving away from the one and done mentality, new world learning doesn’t end. Dynamic learning is about pushing the boundaries of education, going beyond the idea of the traditional school day, beyond the physical location of the classroom, beyond using tools as digital substitutes or even beyond the traditional motion of hard and fast due dates.\n\n"<<endl;
