cout<<"What is Governance?"

"\n\nGOVERNANCE can be seen as the exercise of economic, political and administrative authority to manage a country’s affairs at all levels. It comprises the mechanisms, processes and institutions through which citizens and groups articulate their interests, exercise their legal rights, meet their obligations and mediate their differences."

"\n\nGood Governance is, among other things, participatory, transparent and accountable. It is also effective and equitable, and it promotes the rule of law. It ensures that political, social and economic priorities are based on broad consensus in society and that the voices of the poorest and the most vulnerable are heard in decision making over the allocation of development resources."


"\n\n\nCharacteristics of good governance"

"\n\n1. Participation"

"\n\nAll men and women, inclusive of the physically challenged, should have a voice in decision making, either directly or through legitimate intermediate institutions that represent their interests."

"\n\nParticipation is a process whereby policy- making, prioritizing issues, accessibility to public goods and services and also allocating resources is influenced by keys’ stakeholders."

"\n\nPublic involvement includes three elements or pillars:"

"\n\nPublic access to information"

"\n\nPublic participation in decision-making processes"

"\n\nPublic access to judicial and administrative redress often termed access to justice"

"\n\nThese pillars are also known in environmental law parlance as third generation human rights or environmental rights."

"\n\nThey are also part of the basic tenets of good governance."

"\n\nAccess to information can be passive or active."

"\n\nPassive access-is where the public will get information upon request to government institutions"

"\n\nActive access-is whereby the government is obliged to give and disseminate information"

"\n\nAccess to justice is whereby the procedural rights of the public to information are respected and guaranteed."


"\n\n\n2. Rule of Law"

"\n\nLaws, regulations and codes of conduct should be fair and enforced impartially, particularly the laws on human rights."

"\n\nA correct diagnosis of poor governance is important in that it determines practical strategies that are sustainable and effective in reducing poverty."

 
"\n\n\n3. Transparency"

"\n\nIs built on the free flow of information."

"\n\nIt promotes openness action, decision-making processes, and consultative processes among public sector and all stakeholders."

"\n\nLack of transparency, weak accountability, lack of responsiveness and inefficiency also compromise good governance."

 
"\n\n\n4. Responsiveness"

"\n\nInstitutions and processes try to serve all stakeholders within a reasonable time frame."


"\n\n\n5. Consensus Orientation"

"\n\nGood governance mediates differing interests to reach a broad consensus on what in the best interest of the group and, where possible, on policies and procedures. Underlying this characteristic is the theory of consensus and consensus decision making."

 
"\n\n\nConsensus"

"\n\nThe process of achieving consensus involves serious consideration of every group or stakeholders’ considered opinion."

"\n\nIt usually involves collaboration, rather than compromise.  Instead of one opinion being adopted by a plurality, stakeholders are brought together until a convergent decision is developed."

"\n\nConsensus usually involves collaboration, rather than compromise. Instead of one being adopted by a plurality, stakeholders are decision is developed."

 
"\n\n\nConsensus decision-making"

"\n\nIt is a decision process that not only seeks the agreement of most participants, but also to resolve or mitigate the objections of the minority to achieve the most agreeable decision."

"\n\nIt is intended to deemphasize the role or functions or parties and promote the expression of individual voices."

"\n\nThis method also increases the likelihood of unforeseen or creative solutions by juxtaposing dissimilar ideas."

"\n\nIt involves identifying and addressing concerns, generating new alternatives, combining elements of multiple alternatives and checking that people understand a proposal or an argument."

"\n\nThis empowers minorities, those with objections that are hard to state quickly, and those who are less skilled in debate."


"\n\n\n6. Equity"

"\n\nAll men and women have opportunities to improve or maintain their well-being."

 
"\n\n\n7. Effectiveness and efficiency "

"\n\nProcesses and institutions produce results that meet needs while making the best use of resources."

"\n\nThe characteristic promotes efficient public delivery systems and quality public outputs. It deals with the amount of public respect the civil service has."

 
"\n\n\n8. Accountability"

"\n\nDecision-makers in government, the private sector and civil society organizations are accountable to the public, as well as to institutional stakeholders."

"\n\nThis accountability differs depending on the organization and whether the decision is internal or external to an organization."

"\n\n2 Pillars of Public Accountability"
"\n1. Related to accountability by the executive"
"\n2. Based on institutional change"

"\n\n4 Categories of Accountability"
"\n1. Public"
"\n2. Financial"
"\n3. Horizontal"
"\n4. Vertical-one actor reports to another subject to the interpretation of constitutional provisions\n\n"<<endl;
