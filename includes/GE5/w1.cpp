	"1. Informative Speech - An informative speech is aimed at disseminating information regarding a certain topic to an audience (Purposive7-11, n.d.). Furthermore, this type of speech should provide the audience beneficial information regarding the subject of the speech. The parts of this speech are the introduction, body, and conclusion. An example of this speech is Marie Curie’s speech regarding the discovery of radium. The following is an excerpt of the speech from Purposive7-11 (n.d.)."
	"\"I could tell you many things about radium and radioactivity and it would take a long time. But as we cannot do that, I shall only give you a short account of my early work about radium. Radium is no more a baby, it is more than twenty years old, but the conditions of the discovery were somewhat peculiar, and so it is always of interest to remember them and to explain them. We must go back to the year 1897. Professor Curie and I worked at that time in the laboratory of the school of Physics and Chemistry where Professor Curie held his lectures."
	"I was engaged in some work on uranium rays which had been discovered two years before by Professor Becquerel.***I spent some time in studying the way of making good measurements of the uranium rays, and then I wanted to know if there were other elements, giving out rays of the same kind."
	"So, I took up a work about all known elements, and their compounds and found that uranium compounds are active and also all thorium compounds, but other elements were not found active, nor were their compounds."
	"As for the uranium and thorium compounds, I found that they were active in proportion to their uranium or thorium content.\n\n"
	
	"\n\n2. Persuasive Speech - Persuasion is defined as an attempt to influence another person’s attitudes, beliefs, or behavior (Purposive7-11, n.d.). In a persuasive speech, the speaker’s goal is to persuade their audience and convince or influence them in some way (Purposive7-11, n.d.). The speaker may convince the audience to move or act for a certain cause or adopt the opinion or belief of the speaker. An example of this speech comes from Martin Luther King Jr. The following is an excerpt of \"I Have a Dream\" by Martin Luther King Jr. from Purposive7-11 (n.d.).\""
	"\"Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\"\n"

	"\n\nPrinciples of Speech Delivery\n"

	"\nAccording to Lucas (2012), good speech delivery should convey the speaker's ideas interestingly and clearly without leaving the audience distracted. Furthermore, the audience \"prefer delivery that combines a certain degree of formality with the best attributes of good conversation-directness, spontaneity, animation, vocal and facial expressiveness, and a lively sense of communication\" (Lucas, 2012, p.240).\n\n"

	"1. Articulation refers to the speaker's ability to have clear diction, the proper pronunciation of words, and effectively convey their message (Jimenez, 2017).\n"	
	"\n2. Modulation refers to the ability \"to adjust or manipulate the resonance and timbre of the vocal tone\" (Jimenez, 2017, para. 3).\n"
	"\n3. Stage Presence refers to the ability of the speaker to control the stage, fill the stage, and show their personality to their audience (Jimenez, 2017).\n"
	"\n4. Facial Expression, Gestures, Movement, Audience Rapport\n"
	
		"\n\t* Facial expression helps the speaker connect to the audience. It can show the speaker’s sincerity, credibility, and emotions (Jimenez, 2017).\n"
		"\n\t* Gestures can help the speaker emphasize, express their emotions, and interact with their audience (Jimenez, 2017).\n"
		"\n\t* Movements can make your speech dramatic and prevents it from being monotonous (Jimenez, 2017).\n"
		"\n\t* Audience Rapport can help you in connecting to your audience (Jimenez, 2017).\n"
	
	"\n\nTools for Effective Delivery\n"
	
	"\nTo be effective in your delivery, watch prominent people deliver their speeches in public. While observing, the following are four points to take note of:\n\n"
	
	"How they approach their audience - Are they formal or informal? Is their speech style personal, conversational, or casual?\n"
	"\nHow they connect with their audience - Are they using eye contact, body movements, gestures, and facial expressions?\n"
	"\nHow they present themselves - Are they confident to stand on the stage? How do they look? How do they stand, walk, and use nonverbal cues on and off the stage?\n"
	"\nHow they use their voice in terms of the following:\n\n"
	
		"\ta. Volume - loudness or softness of voice\n"
		"\tb. Pitch - highness or lowness of voice\n"
		"\tc. Rate or speed - fastness or slowness of speech\n"
		"\td. Pauses to show emphasis and improve the clarity of the message\n"
		"\te. Vocal variety - effective changes in volume, pitch, rate, and pauses\n"
		"\tf. Pronunciation - correct enunciation of words\n"
	
	"\nThree essential questions to ask before an oral presentation:\n\n"
	
		"\t1. Type of your presentation you are going to do or the types of speech according to a purpose. Why am I doing this presentation? Am I going to explain, argue, persuade, or inform?\n"
		"\n\t2. Target audience. To whom am I presenting? Who will be the people to listen to me or read my work? If you know your audience, then you will have an idea of what to include in your speech because you have to give them information that will help or influence them.\n"
		"\n\t3. The overall goal for the presentation. You must know your goal for the presentation because your speech, preparation, and materials all depend on it."
		" What is my intended outcome upon the completion of my presentation?\n"<<endl;
