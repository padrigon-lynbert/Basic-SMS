cout<<"Text"

"\n\nWe usually think \"text\" is anything that is written or typed with letters, words, and sentences. However, the term \"text\" in communication studies means anything that can be analyzed to have meaning. It is made of a combination of signs that convey a specific meaning. We should view a text as something that is complete and something that exists in a particular context (Lotman, 1977)."

"\n\n\nultural Text"

"\n\nWhat is cultural text? Cultural text is a text that reflects a particular culture. It shows a specific society's ideas, beliefs, and behaviors (Malley & Hawkins, n.d; Tylor, 1871). Thus, the cultural text conveys cultural meanings."

"\n\n\nWhy Do We Evaluate Text?"

"\n\nHave you ever wondered why only you and your friends understand a funny meme (a text) while your parents don't? When you and your friends reach a consensus of what the meme means, you and your friends have evaluated the meme's comedic meaning. Unfortunately, your parents did not have enough information why you thought the meme was funny."


"\n\n\nConcepts to Note When Evaluating Text"

"\n\nBefore we can evaluate text, we need to take note of the contextual aspects of a text (Thoman & Jolls, 2003)."

"\n\n* Sender - All texts are constructed by a person. A tree is not sending a message. On the other hand, an artist can draw a tree to convey a message."
"\n\n* Rules and Form - Texts are constructed using meaningful signs (language) and rules of form, grammar, and other rules of communication."
"\n\n* Reception of the Audience - Different people will receive or understand a text differently."
"\n\n* Point of View - Texts are embedded with values, ideas, and points of view."
"\n\n* Purpose - Texts are made for certain purposes. Messages are placed in the text to inform, persuade, or entertain the receiver of the message. For instance, advertisements are made to convince us to buy items. Another example would be why electoral candidates have their own social media page: to convince voters to vote for them."

"\n\n\nHow to Evaluate Text"

"\n\nTo evaluate a text, we find information about the contextual aspects of a text. The following table shows what questions we may ask to study a text. We take the example of the picture below to demonstrate the evaluation process."<<endl;
