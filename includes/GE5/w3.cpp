cout<<"Each culture has its own rules and principles for communication, as these cultures would have varying norms, behaviors, and actions (02A lesson proper, n.d.). Moreover, the meaning behind actions and behaviors would depend on the context and culture."

"\n\nAccording to Hall and Hall (1987, as cited in, 02A lesson proper, n.d.), context cannot be separated from an event as the context is what gives it meaning. Different cultures would communicate with varying levels of context."

"\n\nFirst, in low-context communication, the information is explicit, and the receiver of the message would likely understand the information (Barchas-Lichtenstein, 2016). In these cultures, individuals separate themselves and stay secretive about their lives, and the burden of meaning would fall on the sender of the message (02A lesson proper, n.d.). Furthermore, low-context communication is more common in individualistic cultures (Barchas-Lichtenstein, 2016). Examples of these are Americans and Germans."

"\n\nSecond, in high-context communication, most of the information is implied rather than explicit (Barchas-Lichtenstien, 2016). Furthermore, the burden of meaning would fall on the receiver of the message as there is little explicit information is transmitted (02A lesson proper, n.d.). High-context communication is more common in collectivist cultures (Barchas-Lichtenstein, 2016). An example of this culture is the Japanese."

"\n\n\nNonverbal Communication"

"\n\nBody language is different and must be learned effectively to communicate the intended message without giving unintended insults."

"\n\nEye Contact. In some cultures, eye contact means honesty and straightforwardness, while it may come off as challenging and rude in others. In the US, if you have good eye contact with a person, then it generally shows that you are interested in the person. In the Middle East, eye contact is much less common and considered less appropriate than in other countries. In many Asian, African, and Latin American cultures, extended eye contact can be taken as an affront or a challenge of authority. In western Europe, maintaining almost constant eye contact with another person is considered proper and polite."

"\n\nGestures. When greeting friends, people in Russia and France kiss each other on the cheek, while people in other countries greet each other through a firm handshake, a loving hug, and a bow/nod of the head."


"\n\n\nCultural Awareness and Sensitivity Guidelines"

"\n\n\t1. Admit that you do not know. It is okay to tell others that you do not know about their culture. Be humble and open to learn from others."

"\n\n\t2. Develop an awareness of your views, assumptions, and beliefs and how they are shaped by your culture. One way is to communicate with people or friends of a different culture. Appreciate and celebrate differences. Do not find ways to beat differences; instead, respect each other’s culture."

"\n\n\t3. Take an interest. Getting to know other people means opening ways of communication by being interested in their culture."

"\n\n\t4. Do not make judgments. Commenting that another’s culture is bad and not interesting is not polite. Remember that every culture, similar to a person, is unique."

"\n\n\t5. Once you have collected information, start to check your assumptions. Find materials to prove your assumptions. Make sure the facts are verifiable and your proof is sound."

"\n\n\t6. Develop empathy. Be thankful for what you have. Empathize with others who do not have much in life. Do not be negative toward their misfortune."


"\n\n\nVarieties andRegisters of Spoken and Written Language"

"\n\nVariety refers to any variant of a language that can be sufficiently delimited from one another."

"\n\n\t1. Pidgin - These are new languages that are developed when there are individuals who speak different languages need to communicate, but they do not share a common language (Language varieties, n.d.). The vocabulary of a pidgin comes from a lexifier or a particular language. An example of this is West African Pidgin English."

"\n\n\t2. Creole – These are languages developed from a pidgin that become the mother tongue of a community (Language varieties, n.d.). These languages include the Jamaican Creole (Patois), Krio (Sierra Leone, Africa), and Chavacano in the Philippines."

"\n\n\t3. Regional dialect – These are languages that are spoken in a particular area of a country (Language varieties, n.d.). Several regional dialects were given traditional names that would give them a distinction from the standard varieties spoken in that same area. Ex. Cebuano, Ilocano, and Hiligaynon"

"\n\n\t4. Minority dialect - A variety used as a marker of identity that is generally with a standard variety by the members of a particular minority ethnic group (Language varieties, n.d.). Ex. African American Vernacular English in the USA"

"\n\n\t5. Indigenized variety - This is mainly used as a second language in former colonies with multilingual populations (Language varieties, n.d.) Ex. Singlish (spoken in Singapore)"


"\n\n\nRegister"

"\n\nAccording to Crystal (2003), a register is the variety of language defined by its use in a particular social situation."

"\n\nAccording to Joos (1968), there are five speech styles."

"\n\n\t1. Intimate is a private speech style; that is, it only occurs between or among close family members or individuals because the language use may not be shared in public."

"\n\n\t2. Casual is a speech style that is used among peers and friends; the language used is generally jargon, slang, or vernacular."

"\n\n\t3. Consultative is a speech style that is standard because this is the one used by professionals in the field. Ex. Newscasting"

"\n\n\t4. Formal style is one that is used in formal settings, but in contrast to consultative, this speech style is one-way; no slang words are allowed. Ex. Sermons by priests and ministers, State of the Nation Address of the President, formal speeches, or pronouncements by judges."

"\n\n\t5.    Frozen is a speech style that remains unchanged. Ex. The preamble to the Constitution or the Lord’s prayer."<<endl;
