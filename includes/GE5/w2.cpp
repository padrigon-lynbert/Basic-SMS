cout<<"\nFunctions of Art\n"
"\n\tAristotle claimed that every particular substance on earth has an end or \"telos\" in Greek, which means \"purpose.\" "
" Think of the purpose of things around you, such as chairs, tables, picture frames, cups, books, chandeliers, furniture, etc."
"Each of them serves a purpose. This purpose is the reason why they are made or why they exist in this world. The telos or purpose is directly related to the function.\n"

"\n\nFor things to serve its purpose, it must fulfill its function. \n\nThe following are different functions of art:"

"\n\n\tPersonal Function. It is the use of art merely for personal gain. It is highly subjective and depends on how a person used an art."
" It is one of the most confusing functions of art to explain. Several examples that are associated with personal function are expressive art, art entertainment, and art therapy. A person can use art for self-expression."
" Similar to many artists, people find relief and gratification when they can express themselves. "
" The way each person expresses is through the use of different mediums and techniques to produce an artwork. Art can also be used to communicate personal thoughts."

"\n\n\t\tExamples: A good example is the songs; a person uses words and melodies to communicate a message to a listener."
" A pursuer may compose a poem to communicate his affection to a woman. Art can serve a therapeutic effect on a person."
" Today, art is used by counselors and psychologists to treat abnormal psychological conditions, such as trauma, anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, social skills deficit, and self-esteem."
" The present research shows that art improves mental health and wellness."

"\n\nSocial Function. Art serves social functions when it can influence other people (Benjy, 2016)."
" Several types of art are intended to persuade the public. The works of Jose Rizal, that is, Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, were not only works of art but they brought about change in society."
" The novels of Rizal influenced the mind of the Filipinos during that time. Rizal awakened the mind of the Filipinos and led to a revolution from the Spanish regime."

"\n\n\t\tExamples: As you walk in the street, you may be able to see murals painted on the walls."
" One example of arts’ social function is advertisement. Whether you see it on the television, newspapers, or billboards, they are capable of persuading us into shifting our purchasing behavior or overall attitude about a product or service."
" This is most often used by politicians during campaign season, where they campaign their own advocacies to sway the people into voting them."

"\n\n\tPhysical Function. The physical world is directly related to art as it serves as both the source and inspiration of it."
" For instance, eating utensils alone, are composed of physical shapes and curvatures that can be turned into a minimalist installation."
" Same with ordinary objects like cups or chairs, that are intricate in their own geometrical purposefulness."
" This is best exemplified in the field of Architecture, where architects use art as a physical function to create homes, offices and even conducive city spaces."
" Industrial and interior design also uses the physical function of art at its core to create specific designs that cater to the physical needs of the people."

"\n\n\nPhilosophies of Art"

"\n\nPhilosophy of art is the study of the nature of art, including interpretation, representation, expression, and form that is closely related to aesthetics,"
" which is the philosophical study of beauty and taste. Several philosophies of art are listed as follows:"

"\n\nArt as Imitation"
"\nArt as imitation came from the Greek Philosopher Plato. In his book, “Republic,” he considered artists as imitators and art as a mere imitation of what is in the reality."
" Plato disagreed with the inclusion of art in the curriculum because it highly affects human reasoning. For Plato, the true real world is the world of forms or the eternal world."
" He believed that everything on earth is only an imperfect copy of what is in the world of forms."
" Thus, whatever the artist is doing is already an imitation, and art=making is considered to be a work of imitation."
" For example, a chair that one sits on is not a perfect chair, but it is only an imperfect copy of a perfect chair in the world of forms."
" For Plato, the artist reinforces the belief in copies and prevents people to reach the true entities in the world of forms."

"\n\nArt as Representation"
"\nThis view of art came from Aristotle. According to him, all arts have their techniques and rational principles, and the artist/craftsman brings his conceptions through mastery."
" Arts do copy nature, but their representations are fuller and more meaningful than what nature gives us. This factor is the strength of art."
" Therefore, we do not need to insist on some moral purpose for art, which is free to represent all manner of things present, past, imagined, or institutionally required."
" Aristotle believed that art is not a copy of a copy but a version of possible realities. Different from Plato, Aristotle believed that art will help people for the fundamental realities of the world."
" According to Aristotle, art has two purposes, as follows: art allows us to experience pleasure, and art can teach people and lead them to reflect on life."

"\n\nArt for Art's Sake"

"\nA slogan translated from the French word that was coined in the early 19th century by French Philosopher Victor Cousin."
" The phrase expresses the belief held by many writers and artists, especially those associated with aestheticism, that art needs no justification, and it needs to serve no political, didactic, or another end."
" This philosophy sees beauty as something subjective, that is, an artist works for the sake of beauty according to his definition or preference of beauty."
" A good example of it is that on the slide. It a work of Marcel Duchamp in 1917 entitled \"Fountain.\""
" Duchamp believed that an artwork should be judged separately from the other sphere of life, such as morality."<<endl;
