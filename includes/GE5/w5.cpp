cout<<"Different Types of Communication Aids"

"\n\n1. Comprehensive Expressive Aids: These types of aids are designed to cater to the daily communication needs of a person (Sadiq, 2017). Examples of these aids include alphabet boards, communication boards, and books that contain multiple messages that are shown through words, letters, symbols, and photos."

"\n\n2. Targeted Expressive Aids: These aids, such as community request cards or object symbols to allow a person to make basic requests, are designed for certain situations when limited message sets are needed (Sadiq, 2017)."

"\n\n3. Visual Supports:  The purpose of visual supports is to help individuals in making sense of their day, recalling events, and completing their tasks (Sadiq, 2017). Some individuals would have complex communication needs as it is difficult for them to recall their memories and understand abstract information. Examples of visual supports are picture or object calendars, picture shopping lists, and picture social stories."

"\n\n4. Supports for Communication Partners: These types of support “provide details about an individual with complex communication needs, their means of communication and other routine related information that assist a communication partner to consistently support them throughout the day” (Sadiq, 2017, para. 7). Examples are a book about me, a personal communication dictionary, or a personal history."

"\n\n5. Technical Aids or Assistive Technology Devices: The technical aids for communication must allow the client to reach a significant level of independence. Regular, off-the-shelf equipment may occasionally compensate efficiently for certain disabilities and be considered assistive technology devices, but the program does not systematically cover them."

"\n\n\nThe assistive technology devices covered by PMATCOM falls into the following five categories:"

"\n\nA. Speech aids are devices designed to enhance the use of natural speech."

"\n\nB. Augmentative and alternative communication aids are devices designed to replace or augment speech and are mostly used with communication software."

"\n\nC. Adapted telephones are equipment or accessories that allow telephone use and adapted phone services at home for people over 12 years (e.g., adapted telephones with breath control tubes, adapted telephone with scanning access software)."

"\n\nD. Computer access is a device or accessories that enable the functional use of the computer for writing or communication activities. This type of technology is booming. Regular keyboard and mouse have many alternatives, such as an oversized keyboard, keyguards, on-screen keyboard software, and head-pointing devices."

"\n\nE. Environmental control devices are a kind of technology that allows users to control electronic or electrical devices at home remotely (e.g., lights, tv, sound systems, etc.). These aids improve the user’s autonomy and help him stay at home with few caregivers."

"\n\n\nTypes of Traditional Visual and Audio Media:"

"\n\n1. overhead transparencies"

"\n\n2. flip chart"

"\n\n3. whiteboard/chalkboard"

"\n\n4. document camera"

"\n\n5. video"

"\n\n6. handouts"

"\n\n7. sound recordings"<<endl;
