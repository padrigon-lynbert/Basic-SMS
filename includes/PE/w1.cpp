cout<<"Elements of Rhythm:"

"\n\n1. Beat—the underlying pulse of a rhythm."
"\n2. Tempo—rate of speed of a movement."
"\n3. Intensity—variation of stress of movement."
"\n4. Pitch—lowness or highness of a tone."
"\n5. Accent—emphasis on certain beats."
"\n6. Meter—the regular recurrence of beats which divides a musical design into measure."
"\n7. Phrase—measures grouped together."
"\n8. Bar—in music a vertical line across a staff dividing it into equal measures of time."
"\n9. Count—a pulse beat, a time limit."
"\n10. Note—a printed symbol of a musical tone."
"\n11. Measure—a group of pulse beats."
"\n12. Note pattern—refers to a note or set of notes with or without rest used for a certain dance step."
"\n\13. Step pattern—refers to the movement or movements done for each of the dance steps."


"\n\n\nWhat are the five phases of rhythmic activity program?"

"\n\nAerobics - a kind of exercise that merges rhythmic aerobic exercise and strength training exercise."
"\nBreak dancing - an athletic style of dance."
"\nGymnastics - a sport that needs balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination and endurance in order to execute."
"\nBending - a movement around a joint."
"\nStretching - muscles or tendons are flexed."

"\n\nElements of movement Space:"

"\n\n1. Direction—is the line of movement taken which maybe forward, backward, sideward, diagonal, upward, or a combination of those mentioned."
"\n2. Level—is movement through space that maybe done at a high, low, or medium level?"
"\n3. Range—refers to the area covered as the body moves. It may be small as when the movement is done in one’s place; or large when movement covers a wide area as when getting away from one’s place."
"\n4. Floor Pattern—the path or design that is made while moving in space is what is termed as floor pattern. It may take a form of a circle, square, straight line or zigzag."
"\n5. Step pattern—refers to the movement or movements done for each of the dance steps.\n\n"<<endl;
