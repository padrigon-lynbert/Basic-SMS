"\n\nFreedom entails the power or rights to act, speak, and choose without any hindrance or restraint. In ethics, Kant introduced the fundamental of morality as “categorical imperative.” His position is that this fundamental principle articulates the inherent and the unconditional value of freedom. Morality assumes that one can choose which is right or wrong. This choice is grounded on the idea that a person is free and can make choices."

"\n\nImmanuel Kant on Morality and Freedom"

"\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724–1804) was a philosopher of German descent, who synthesized modern rationalism and empiricism, set the terms for much of the 19th- and 10th-century philosophy, and still influences up to this day in terms of ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, and other disciplines. Given that Kant’s philosophy is highly systematic, we should look at his philosophy's theoretical and practical autonomy."

"\n\nTheoretical Philosophy - It is about how the world is. Its supreme principle is self-consciousness, in which the knowledge of basic laws of nature is based. According to sensory data, we understand experience according to the priori laws."

"\n\nPractical Philosophy - It is about how the world ought to be. Its supreme principle is the moral law, from which we derive duties on how we ought to act in a particular situation. Kant’s philosophy claims that reflection in our moral duties and our need for happiness leads us to think of an ideal world, which he claimed as the highest good. "

"\n\nBoth philosophies are based on autonomously constructing the world but from a different perspective. In theoretical philosophy, we use our intuition and senses to build a world of experience or nature. Meanwhile, in practical philosophy, we use our moral law to construct the idea of a moral world that guides our conduct and transforms the world into the highest good."

"\n\nValue of Freedom"

"\n\nFreedom - It"

"\n\nTwo Aspects of Worldly Freedom:"

"\n\nfreedom coming from different limits and even restrictions, etc., which are detrimental to one’s legitimate well-being and development."

"\n\nFreedom to act in such a way to enable one to realize one’s potentialities in the best way possible. (Bhatt, 2018)"

"\n\nHence, freedom is the absence of external constraints and the availability of objective conditions and practical opportunities for self-realization."

"\n\nFreedom, Consciousness, and Creativity"

"\n\nHumans’ existing call for freedom is cognized by consciousness. A creative activity to cognize and convert human and cosmic presence is also due to consciousness. Thus, freedom and consciousness are organized. Humans feel greater than other living existence because of freedom, creativity, and consciousness."

"\n\nFreedom, Equality, and Justice"

"\n\nFreedom, equality, and justice commensurate with one another. A human being is a social creature. Freedom is meaningful only in a social context and framework. Sociality has three foundations, as follows:"

"\n\ncoexistence\n\ncooperation\n\nmutual caring and sharing"

"\n\nEquality and justice do not reduce or limit freedom; instead, they make freely available to all. Thus, equality of chance and dissemination of justice is established as two pillars to provide a solid underpinning to freedom and social cohesion."

"\n\nFreedom, Rights, and Duties"

"\n\nIf equality is to be attained for peace and prosperity, then a system of rights and duties embedded in a democratic framework of society and state should be present. Rights are afforded to any person regardless of personality, race, age, or sex. But, if each individual is to enjoy a modicum of freedom and be protected from unwarranted trespass, then the interrelationship among individuals must be defined by a system of rights and obligations. Likewise, the structure and limits of social organizations should be defined and designed to preserve and promote the primary value of freedom. Based on the rights-based approach, everyone has the right not to be harmed. Thus, a person is obligated to do no harm to another person on the basis of this right. The relationship between freedom and rights is reciprocal; if one is not free, he cannot enjoy freedom or fight for freedom. Nonetheless, rights safeguard an individual’s freedom. (Bhatt, 2018)"

"\n\nFreedom and Authority"

"\n\nFreedom is not a license, and it has to be circumscribed by a social authority. Freedom and authority are not incompatible. We cannot make freedom unconditional. Freedom has to be within the contours of social authority. Thus, freedom means the freedom of an individual in society. A human’s freedom is carved out relative to others. However, it must also consider one’s awareness of one’s needs and aspirations, potentialities, capabilities, and scope to exercise choice and options to realize the objectives set forth for one’s meaningful existence. (Bhatt, 2018)"

"\n\nResponsibility as a Consequence of Freedom and Need for Ethics"

"\n\nResponsibility is a result of freedom. As stated earlier, philosophy is a systematic reflection of our lived experiences to profit from it. One of our most problematic experiences is human behavior because it is indeterminate and unpredictable but concerning, which paradoxically constant endeavor made for determination and regulation. Given that humans do all pollution and perversion, human conduct should be regulated. The discipline of ethics is primarily concerned with the postulation of norms for good human life and the regulation of human conduct following these norms. Assuming that a human being is a rational, free, and responsible agent, ethical considerations, theorizing, and judgments are undertaken. Human conduct can be regulated and abide by norms. This is the objective of the discipline of ethics. (Bhatt, 2018)"

"\n\nExcuses – An excuse is based on a reason for an action or omission that reduces responsibility.  Excuses come in degrees. Thus, to claim that one is compelled to do something means that you do not have the power to do otherwise, freeing a person from blame entirely. You can reduce responsibility if you are coerced to do an act. In this case, you could resist, but the threat of not acting is considerable. Coercion may reduce but not eliminate responsibility. In mild cases, the term \"duress\" is used."

"\n\nExample: You cheated on a test. You did so partly because you were emotionally exhausted for just knowing about the divorce of your parents, as well as the death of a beloved dog, and you think you might be responsible for your roommate coming down with the plague."

"\n\nHarm and Voluntariness – If you voluntarily agree to a harmful activity (i.e., boxing), then the harm caused to you is not a violation or an injury that should be compensated for."

"\n\nForgiveness - the term forgiveness comes from the term “release from resentment”. Asking of forgiveness is a choice or an obligation to others; it is occasionally the same as forgetting."


"Libertarianism - \"Libertarians strongly value individual freedom and see this as justifying strong protections for individual freedom. Thus, libertarians insist that justice poses stringent limits to coercion. While people can be justifiably forced to do certain things, they cannot be coerced to serve the overall good of society or even their good. As a result, libertarians endorse strong rights to individual liberty and private property.\" (van der Vossen, 2019)"

"\n\nThey defend civil liberties such as equal rights for the LGBTQA+, endorse drug decriminalization, open borders, and oppose most military interventions."

"\n\nSelf-Ownership - \"This theory is organized around the view that agents initially fully own themselves and have certain moral powers to acquire property rights in external things. This theory sees libertarian policy conclusions as the result of not merely empirical truths or real-world feasibility constraints but as following from the only defensible and restrictive moral principles. The idea of self-ownership is attractive for many reasons. We recognize people as self-owners when we recognize that things may not be done to a person without their consent but may be done with consent. Thus, we consider rape wrong because it involves a body being used against the will of the person to whom it belongs but not because there is something inherently wrong with sexual intercourse.\" (van der Vossen, 2019)"

"\n\nWe consider assault wrong for similar reasons, yet we allow voluntary boxing matches."

"\n\nPower of Appropriate – Libertarian and classical liberal theories conceive of distributive justice as exclusively historical."

"\n\n\"To ask whether justice is obtained in the world is mainly to ask whether people have been justly treated principally whether their rights to their persons and possessions have been respected. The most common mode of just acquisition is through the legitimate transfer of prior just holdings. This is why libertarians generally defend noncoerced, nondeceptive market relations as just.\" (van der Vossen, 2019)"


"\n\nDeterminism - Determinism pertains to a theory that all events, including moral choices, are completely determined by previously existing causes. Determinism precludes  free will because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they usually do. The theory indicates that the universe is utterly rational because complete knowledge of any given situation assures that unerring future knowledge is also possible. (Britannica, n.d.)"

"\n\nHard Determinism - sees free will as an illusion and believes that every event and action has a cause."

"\n\nSoft Determinism - represents a middle ground; people choose, but are constrained by external or internal factors. However, the problem with determinism is that it is inconsistent with society’s ideas of responsibility and self-control that form the basis of our moral and legal obligations (Mcleod, 2019)."

"\n\nCompatibilism - given that free will is a necessary condition of moral responsibility, compatibilism is occasionally expressed as a thesis about the compatibility between moral responsibility and determinism. (McKenna, 2019)"

"\n\nMinimum Requirements on Morality: Role of Reason and Impartiality"

"\n\nMorality is our basis in identifying what is good or bad and right or wrong. But the basis of our moral judgment must be supported by a valid and good reason we act or do our actions. The minimum requirements should be that you know the fact and you have the moral reasoning to support your argument. Second, moral judgment requires the impartial consideration of each individual’s interest."

"Moral Reasoning - is consistent with practical reasoning; it is a type of reasoning that is directed toward deciding what to do and, when successful, issuing an intention. Reasoning is the guiding principle in assessing his/her reasons and other applicable rationality. It also attempts to provide well-supported answers to well-paced problems or questions."

"\n\nChallenges to Moral Reasoning"

"\n\nOur moral thinking is often not explicit; we also reason tacitly in the same way with our thinking explicitly, but it was not well-supported."

"\n\nWe opt not to think or reason explicitly because we are in a pressing emergency and cannot deliberate our options and actions."

"\n\nIn summary, moral reasoning:"

"\n\ndoes not rely on personal feelings, regardless of how powerful it may be."

"\n\npersonal feelings may be irrational and nothing but products of prejudice, selfishness, or cultural conditioning."

"\n\nour decision must be guided as much as possible by reason."

"\n\nthe morally right things to do are always the thing best supported by arguments."

"\n\nHow can we determine whether an argument is good?"

"\n\nGet the facts straight."

"\n\nBring moral principles into play. Are they justified, and are they being corrected applied?"

"\n\nRequirement of Impartiality"

"\n\nImpartiality – pertains to a principle of justice wherein the decisions should be based on objective criteria instead of bias, prejudice, or preference to one person over another for an unacceptable reason."

"\n\nIn this context, impartiality denotes the following:"

"\n\nEach individual’s interest is equally important, and no one should get special treatment."

"\n\nIf people should not be treated differently, then discrimination is unacceptable and arbitrary. "

"\n\nImpartiality must be backed up by good reason."


"\n\n\nMinimum Conception of Morality"

"\n\nThe minimum conception of morality is that “morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one’s conduct by reason – that is, to do what is the best reason for doing while giving equal weight to the interests of each individual affected by one’s decision.”"

"\n\n\nConscientious Moral Agent"

"\n\nIt is concerned impartially with the interests of everyone affected by what he or she does."

"\n\nIt carefully sifts facts and examines their implications."

"\n\nIt accepts the principles of conduct only after scrutinizing them to make sure they are justified."

"\n\nIt is willing to “listen to reason” even when it means revising prior convictions."

"\n\nIt is willing to act on the results of this deliberation.\n\n"<<endl;
