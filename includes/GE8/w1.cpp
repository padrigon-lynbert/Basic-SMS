cout<<"Introduction to Morality"

"\n\nAs children, we were taught what is right and wrong, and good and bad about human life. However, can we distinguish what is morally right from what is not? Science is based on facts, but morality is according to one's values and understanding of things and actions. While science is objective, morality is subjective. Living through values is a perpetual part of our lives. For instance, morality is when we assess a particular action as right or wrong, a person as good or bad, cruel or kind, and just or unjust; this is the foundation of experience values. What we think and do as we experience them is the primary concern of ethics."

"\n\nThe majority of us experience two contradicting feelings and share them with others in life. One is based on our decision and judgment based on our moral values. The other feeling comes from experiencing getting another person's advice on what should be done in a situation. This advice is usually given based on the morals of the advice-giver. With this context, we can say that no one person is a moral expert. For instance, some believe that legalizing abortion is beneficial to society as it allows women to be more active and helpful participants in society. Others believe that legalizing abortion limits the benefits society will get from the next generation. Both arguments are based on the moral principle of doing good to society. Both choices also make people uncomfortable because it undermines certain morals. "

"\n\nMaking moral choices are easier when we share the same morals as the people who advise us. In reality, making decisions is challenging because different persons will have different moralsâ€”making decisions becomes complicated when faced with a dilemma. "

"\n\n\nMorality and Law"

"\n\nOccasionally, we associate something immoral as illegal, but what is the difference between morality and law? Law is the set of rules created by state institutions, which makes law the state's authority. Law has sanctions recognized by the state and enforced by authorized state bodies. We may distinguish between morality and laws in terms of sanctions, deliberation, and extent of implementation."


"\n\n\nLaw"

"\n\nLaw regulates and controls external human conduct. It is not concerned with inner motives. A person may have an evil intention in his or her mind, but the law does not care about it."

"\n\nLaw is universal in a particular society. All individuals are equally subjected to it. It does not change from man to man."

"\n\nPolitical laws are precise and definite because a regular organ that formulates the law exists in every state."

"\n\nLaw is framed and enforced by a determinate political authority. It enjoys the sanction of the state. A punishment generally follows the disobedience of the law."

"\n\nLaw falls within the purview of a subject known as jurisprudence."

"\n\n\nMorality"

"\n\nMorality regulates and controls the inner motives and external actions. It is concerned with the whole life of a man. Thus, the law's scope is limited compared with morality because the law is only concerned with external actions and does not take into its fold the inner motives. Morality condemns a person if he or she has evil intentions; laws are not applicable unless these intentions manifest externally."

"\n\nMorality is variable. It changes from man to man and from age to age. Every man has his moral principles."

"\n\nMoral laws lack precision and definiteness because no authority makes and enforces them."

"\n\nMorality is neither framed nor enforced by any political authority. The state does not support moral values. Breaching moral principles is not accompanied by punishment. The only check against the breach of morality is social condemnation or individual conscience. Moral actions are a matter of choice of an individual's inner conscience; laws are a matter of compulsion."

"\n\nMorality is studied under a separate branch of knowledge known as ethics."


"\n\n\nRelationship Between Law and Morals"

"\n\nThe impact of morality in a universal sense is also inherent in a wide range of various laws. For instance, in the commercial world, laws criminalizing bribery and the imposition of legal duties on company directors embody what would commonly be considered the \"right\" or moral way to conduct business. However, the law is influenced by a wide range of political, social, economic, and cultural factors, and the moral climate of society is only one of these factors. In practice, many laws have a bureaucratic, administrative, and technical function. They operate as an essential part of a complex modern society and have little or no connection with morality. Moral values are not static; they evolve. Laws may change as a consequence."

"\n\n\nMorality and Religion"

"\n\nExodus 20:13 stated that \"Thou shalt not kill,\" one of the Ten Commandments in the bible. If we can ground our morality to God, it can be objective; we can confidently determine our moral obligations and rights. We can also answer why one ought to live morally. In this sense, we will discuss two religious morality theories that will guide us in determining the relationship between morality and religion and how it does not make you a moral person. One of the religious morality theories is divine command theory (DCT). DCT is a simple theory that our moral obligations are similar to our moral duties and based on God's commandments. Thus, if God exists and issues a command, \"thou shalt not steal,\" then it is our moral duty not to steal, which will be the premise of our morality. However, if God does not exist and does not issue this command, then it is permissible. DCT also allows us to determine the overriding of the theory of other motivations, such as self-interest and confidence. This theory emphasizes obedience and submission to God. By contrast, Robert Adams (1999) believed that the actuality of objective moral obligation is logical only if a personal God exists."

"\n\nThe next theory of religious morality is the natural law theory of morality (NLT). This approach to morality does not reject that God issues commands; it takes morality to be in God's creation of the universe and rational human beings. The impression is that the universe is created by God while holding a natural tenacity. These purposes can be determined by careful study through the use of our reason. From the knowledge of the proper purposes of objects, one can identify the appropriate ways to interact with the world and each other. The NLT simply bends the idea of an object's function to its purpose, which further suggests how it is to be used. "

"\n\nBriefly, this approach to morality has the following three mechanisms:"

"\n\nGod created the universe, including human beings and other objects, with purposes."

"\n\nThe purpose of objects in the world can be discerned using natural reason. God endowed humans with a capacity for natural reason."

"\n\nThe purpose for which God created an object determines its proper use."


"\n\n\nReligious Morality"

"\n\nRelating our moral obligation and duties to religion and God brings about the action we ought to perform and its governing action. Although our moral responsibility is independent of our religious beliefs, we can still insist that religious faith significantly contributes to our moral values and how we live our moral life. In other words, religious practices might support our moral life in self-governing ways of defining how we ought to live and act. A good example is that we fear divine punishment, which motivates us to do what is right. One's reason for not committing murder is because they fear hell. However, morality is doing the right thing for the right reason, and that fear is not the right reason to do the right thing. Thus, such an action is not truly a moral action or does not make you a moral person."

"\n\n\nMoral Standard Vs. Nonmoral Standard"

"\n\nDifferent societies must have different beliefs and norms that are influenced by culture. Therefore, values have implications for the moral standards of a particular community. For instance, divorce is significantly allowed in Western countries; in the Philippines, it is not acceptable. Another example is how Muslims dress compared with people of other religions. Some cultures do not dictate how women should dress. On the other hand, Muslim women wear a hijab (head covering) as part of their culture and norms. Hence, different cultures and norms mean varying moral standards. Looking at differences of moral values among cultures is how moral and nonmoral standards are differentiated."

"\n\nMoral Standards and Its Characteristics"

"\n\nMoral standards are norms that are universally shared. Moral standards emphasize that right decisions are those that contribute to the well-being and welfare of humans, animals, and the environment. Moral standards guide us on what ought to be done in terms of a human's obligations and rights. To some extent, many scholars argued that moral standards are a combination of norms and values. Norms are rules about our actions and behavior. For instance, telling lies is wrong. Meanwhile, values are said to be a statement of what is right or necessary or not. For example, during an exam, we may say that cheating is wrong."

"\n\nFive Characteristics of Moral Standard:"

"\n\nMoral standards include substantial injuries or benefits whether humans, the environment, or animals."

"\n\nMoral standards are not set and may be changed by authoritarian bodies or individuals."

"\n\nMoral standards are favored over other values and consider even self-interest."

"\n\nMoral standards are based on impartial considerations."

"\n\nMoral standards are associated with particular emotions such as guilt and shame, good or bad, and right or wrong."

"\n\nNonmoral Standards"

"\n\nNonmoral standards are typically based on taste, choice, and preferences. For instance, it is a moral standard that honesty is a good policy, but some cultures think it is disrespectful to be brutally frank. Other examples include how we judge manners as good or bad in the standard of etiquette, how we judge legal from illegal based on law, and how we regard art as good or garbage in terms of aesthetics. The violation of these standards does not harm the well-being of humans."


"\n\n\nDilemmas"

"\n\nDo you remember a time when you had to choose with each option being hostile? Perhaps you lied, and you were faced with revealing the truth or getting penalized for lying. This circumstance is called a dilemma, a situation where you are being challenged for an agreeable solution. The dilemma has three types that are still present today; these are classical, ethical, and moral dilemmas."

"\n\nClassical Dilemma â€“ It is a choice between two or more alternatives in which the outcomes are equally undesirable or favorable. The dilemma does not typically involve a moral or ethical crisis, but the person or character's life may change due to their decision. A classical dilemma is complicated because an individual will have to weigh the outcomes of choices."

"\n\n\nExamples of a Classical Dilemma:"

"\n\nchoosing where to go for lunch on a first date"

"\n\ndeciding which option to take between two job offers"

"\n\nEthical Dilemma - This dilemma arises when an individual is involuntary in choosing between two morally sound decisions. They may also struggle with the conventional limitations of a commercial, a state agency, or the law. Several ethical dilemmas may include the following: the truth versus being loyal to a friend, following the laws or rules versus having sympathy for an individual's difficulty, and fears about a person versus considerable influence on a community. Typically, an ethical dilemma arises when both choices have advantages."

"\n\nExamples of an Ethical Dilemma:"

"\n\nA secretary discovered that his boss embezzled money from the office. He must decide whether he will turn him to the authorities or the owner of the company."

"\n\nA doctor disapproves of giving a terminally ill patient morphine, but the nurse suggests morphine because he sees the patient suffering. "

"\n\nMoral Dilemma - This dilemma is a choice where a person is torn between right or wrong. A moral dilemma is where there is a conflict with a person's values and principles. The person's choice may leave an individual to question their values, feel guilty about their actions, and feel burdened or relieved. A moral dilemma forces a person to act or decide which choice he/she can live with, but an outcome is seriously unpleasant no matter what."



"\n\n\nExamples of a Moral Dilemma:"

"\n\nA total of 11 passengers are on board a sinking ship, but only 10 lifeboats are available. A decision must be made as to who will stay on the ship."

"\n\nA train with broken breaks is fast approaching people on the tracks. On the left side is a woman crossing with her children, while on the right side is an engineer fixing the track. The train driver should decide on which side to divert the fast-moving train."

"\n\nA wife discovered that she is terminally ill; she wants her husband's help to end her agony before her health deteriorates further."

"\n\nA moral dilemma can also be present in several subject areas, such as legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana, abortion, government spying, the death penalty, and the drug war."

"\n\nThree Levels of Moral Dilemmas"

"\n\nIndividual Level - Dilemma is based on the individual perspective or moral values and ethical standards of a person. It can be influenced by peer pressure, socioeconomic status, and personal financial position."

"\n\nOrganization Level â€“ Dilemma is based on the embedded ethical standards in terms of policy and procedure and forms part of the organization's foundation. However, these policies and procedures are derived from the system level or macro-perspective of moral dilemmas."

"\n\nSystemic Level â€“ At this level or the macro-perspective, the ethical standards are defined and influenced by the wide operating environment in which the organization exists. Factors such as government policies, economic conditions, and societal attitudes affect the organization's regulations, standards, and policies.\n\n"<<endl;
