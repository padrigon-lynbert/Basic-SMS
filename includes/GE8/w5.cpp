cout<<"Direct Quote: Universal Values"

"\n\nThe question that may come to your mind is that, do universal values exist? A value is said to be universal if it applies to all and holds a value that is the same to everyone. The claim for universal values can be interpreted in two different ways, as follows:"

"\n\nIt could be something that has a universal value when everybody finds it valuable."

"\n\nSomething can have universal value if all people have reason to believe that it has value."

"\n\nEvery individual will value certain things, conditions of mind, or behavior as these relate to his or her background and social perspective. Every community will honor certain things, states, and behavior as a result of its environmental location, historical flight, or ideational contextual. Claiming that universal values exist means seeking to uncover something that applies across all persons and communities as a result of their humanity. Such universal values might be derived from scientific investigation, social science testing, or philosophical reflection. They might also arise from nefarious methods, such as imperial practices, ideological and religious proselytizing, and economic exploitation. Exploring universal values requires attention to the values themselves and how they have appeared in the current global order."

"\n\nEveryone in the world values the following six universal or core ethical values:"

"\n\ntrustworthiness\nrespect\nresponsibility\nfairness\ncaring\ncitizenship"

"\n\nUsing these ethical values as the basis for moral reasoning and thinking will help detect a situation wherein, we focus hard on one value that we sacrifice another.” (University of Notre Dame du Lac, n.d.)"

"\n\nFor example, you are loyal to your family member; hence, you are not always telling the truth about their actions."

"\n\nTrustworthiness - It concerns various behaviors, such as honesty, integrity, reliability, and loyalty."

"\n\nHonesty - Honesty is the most fundamental ethical value. We associate honesty with people of honor. We also admire and trust those who are honest."

"\n\nHonesty in communication - It refers to conveying the truth as best as we know it to avoid communication that is likely to mislead or deceive."

"\n\nDirect Quote:"

"\"Four dimensions:"

"\n\nTruthfulness - Truthfulness means not intentionally misrepresenting a fact (lying). The intent is a crucial distinction between truthfulness and truth itself. Being wrong is not the same thing as being a liar, although honest mistakes can still damage trust."

"\n\nSincerity/nondeception - A sincere person does not act, say half-truths, or stay silent to create beliefs or leave impressions that are untrue or misleading."

"\n\nFrankness - Relationships involving trust and honesty may require us to voluntarily give information that another person needs to know."

"\n\nHonesty in conduct - It prohibits stealing, cheating, fraud, and trickery. Cheating is not only about being dishonest but also taking advantage of those who are not cheating. It is a violation of trust and fairness."

"\n\nNot all lies are unethical, although all lies are considered dishonesty. Occasionally, dishonesty is ethically justifiable, such as when the police lie in undercover operations or when someone lies to criminals or terrorists to save lives. However, occasions for ethically sanctioned lying, such as saving a life, are rare."


"\n\n\nIntegrity "

"\n\nIntegrity means the absence of differences in the way an ethical person makes decisions from situation to situation and the way they act at work and home and in public and private. "

"\n\nThe person of integrity takes time for self-reflection so that the events, crises, and the necessities of the day do not determine the course of their moral life. They stay in control."

"\n\nThe four enemies of integrity are: "

"\n\nSelf-interest – things we want "

"\n\nSelf-protection - things we do not want "

"\n\nelf-deception - a refusal to see a situation clearly"

"n\nSelf-righteousness - an end-justifies-the-means attitude"

"\n\nReliability"

"\n\nWhen we make promises or commitments to people our ethical duties go beyond legal obligations. The ethical dimension of promise-keeping imposes the responsibility of making all reasonable efforts to fulfill our commitments. "

"\n\nIt is also important to:"

"\n\nAvoid bad-faith excuses – Honorable people do not rationalize noncompliance or create justifications for escaping commitments. "

"\n\nAvoid unwise commitments – Before making a promise, consider carefully whether you are willing and likely to keep it. Think about the unknown or future events that can make it difficult, undesirable, or impossible for your commitments to keep. Occasionally, all we can do is promise to do our best. "

"\n\nAvoid unclear commitments – Considering that others will expect you to live up to what they think you have promised, be sure that the other person understands what you are committing when you make a promise."

"\n\nLoyalty - is about promoting and protecting the interests of certain people, organizations, or affiliations. Several relationships such as husband-wife, employer-employee, citizen-country, create an expectation of loyalty. "

"\n\nPrioritizing Loyalties"

"\n\nGiven that many individuals and groups make loyalty claims on us, honoring such promises simultaneously is often impossible. Consequently, we must rationally rank our loyalty obligations. In our personal lives, for example, looking out for the interests of our children, parents, and spouses is perfectly reasonable and ethical even if we have to subordinate our obligations to other children, neighbors, or coworkers in doing so."

"\n\nSafeguarding Confidential Information – Loyalty requires us to keep secrets or information learned in confidence."

"\n\nAvoiding Conflicting Interests – Employees and public servants have an additional responsibility to make all professional decisions on merit and not personal interests. Their goal is to maintain the trust of the public."


"\n\n\nRespect "

"\n\nRespect is about honoring the essential worth and dignity of all people, including oneself. We are morally obliged to treat everyone with respect, regardless of who they are and what they have done. We have a responsibility to be the best version we can be in all situations, even when dealing with unpleasant people."

"\n\nRespect focuses on the following: "

"\n\nCivility, Courtesy, and Decency – A respectful person is a good listener. A respectful person treats others with consideration, thereby conforming to accepted notions of taste and propriety, and does not resort to intimidation, coercion, or violence except in extraordinary and limited situations to teach discipline, maintain order, or achieve social justice. "

"\n\nTolerance - An ethical person accepts individual differences and beliefs and judges others only on their character."

"\n\nResponsibility - Life is full of choices. Being responsible means being in charge of our choices and so our lives. It means being accountable for what we do and who we are. Being responsible also means recognizing that what we do and what we do not do matters. "

"\n\nAccountability - An accountable person is not a victim and does not shift blame or claim credit for the work of others. "

"\n\nPursuit of Excellence - The pursuit of excellence has an ethical dimension when others rely upon our knowledge, ability, or willingness to perform tasks safely and effectively. "

"\n\nDiligence - Responsible people are reliable, careful, prepared, and informed. "

"\n\nPerseverance - Responsible people finish what they start, overcoming, instead of surrendering to, obstacles and excuses. "

"\n\nContinuous Improvement - Responsible people look for ways to improve their work. "

"\n\nSelf-Restraint - Responsible people exercise self-control, restraining passions, and appetites (e.g., lust, hatred, gluttony, greed, and fear). They delay gratification if necessary and never feel the need to “win at any cost."


"\n\n\nFairness"

"\n\nFairness is a tricky concept. Disagreeing parties tend to indicate that only one is in a fair position, that is, their own. However, several situations and decisions are unfair, and fairness generally refers to a range of morally justifiable outcomes instead of the discovery of one fair answer. "

"\n\nProcess - A fair person uses open and unbiased processes for gathering and evaluating information necessary to make decisions. Fair people do not wait for the truth to approach them; they seek relevant information and conflicting perspectives before making important decisions."

"\n\nImpartiality - Decisions should be unbiased without favoritism or prejudice. "

"\n\nEquity - The weakness, disadvantage, or ignorance of others should not be taken advantage of. Fairness requires that an individual, company, or society correct mistakes promptly and voluntarily. "

"\n\nCaring - Caring is the heart of ethics. It is scarcely possible to be truly ethical and not genuinely concerned with the welfare of others because ethics is ultimately about our responsibilities toward other people. Occasionally, we must hurt those we care for, and several decisions, although relatively ethical, cause pain. Nevertheless, one should consciously cause no more harm than is reasonably necessary. "

"\n\nCitizenship - The concept of citizenship includes how we ought to behave as a part of a community. The good citizen knows the laws and obeys them, but they also volunteer and stay informed on the issues of the day. Citizens do more than their “fair” share to make society work now and for future generations. Citizenship can have many expressions, such as conserving resources, recycling, using public transportation, and cleaning up litter.” (Hadinoto, 2020)"


"\n\n\nImportance of Universal Values in Human Survival"

"\n\nThe foundation of universal values should be accepted universally. We must know the importance and why universal values are necessary for our survival. Universal values require us to recognize "

"\n\n\"the human characteristics, both good and bad, that we have in common with all our fellow human beings and to show the same respect for human dignity and sensitivity in people of other communities that we expect them to show for ours.\" (United Nations, 2003)"

"\n\n\nValues are important for us because:"

"\n\nit helps us grow and develop;"

"\n\nit helps us create a future we want to experience;"

"\n\nit guides our actions to help us gain influence among those people who matter to us, whose love and respect we crave;"

"\n\nit is important because it creates a connection between you and a group of people;"

"\n\nit tells us how to behave if we want to be accepted, respected, and recognized by a social group but in the most abstract way; and"

"\n\nit is the key or the way to have power, become a good leader, acquire social status, and promote the common good for every human being.\n\n"<<endl;
