"\n\nFilipino Culture"

"\n\nThe Philippines is an archipelago, or a cluster of islands surrounded by bodies of water, and each island has various ethnolinguistic groups with distinct cultures  and languages. The colonial history of the Philippines, such as Spanish, American, and Japanese colonization, radically shaped the cultures in the country and caused the Philippines to have a diverse culture with colonial heritage. In fact, we adopted many words from Spain and incorporated them into our languages, such as “bintana” and “silya.” The Tagalogs, for instance, use “Taglish,” which is a mixed language of Tagalog and English. But most especially, most of the the country’s population have totally embraced Christianity as the official religion of the state, except, of course, in Islamic and indigenous communities in Mindanao and in the mountainous and forested areas of the country. In these parts of the country, people were able to preserve their ancient belief system and traditions despite the centuries of colonial struggles. But what makes Filipino culture unique from the rest of the world?"

"\n\nFilipino Values"

"\n\nThe Filipino values are the distinct system that arises from the culture or way of life of the people, that is, their way of becoming humans in a particular time and space. Values may be defined as the standards by which a group or society judges the desirability and importance of persons, ideas, actions, and goals. These standards are shared convictions or beliefs that contribute to the welfare of the group."

"\n\nFour Folds of Filipino Values"

"\n\n1. Although mankind shares universal values, few values have a distinctively Filipino flavor. The Greek ideal of moderation or medenagan, the Roman in medio stat virtus, and the Filipino equivalent of “hindi labis, hindi kulang, katamtaman lamang” can be compared to Confucian and Buddhist \"doctrine of the Middle\" (Gorospe 2011, p.3)"

"\n\n2. Universally, all people in the world eat and prepare food, but the distinction between cultures is in the manner of preparing or what kind of food are they eating, and it is also true to Filipino traditional cuisines or food culture that is unique from others. Similarly, we also have different tastes in music and other art forms. It is actually easy to identify the difference between Filipino food, language, and music from other foreign cultures. However, according to Gorospe (2011), the distinction is in the manner of ranking, combining, and emphasizing these elements to take on a distinctively Filipino slant or cast. For example, the Chinese may rank the highest for honesty and hard work; Chinese and Japanese cultures both value politeness and beauty;"

"\n\nAmerican culture to promptness and efficiency; and Filipino Culture to trust in God and family-centeredness (Gorospe 2011, p. 3). We can speak of dominant Filipino values in terms of value-making and priority values."

"\n\n3. Universal human values in a Filipino context, such as history, culture, socioeconomic, political, moral, and religion, take on a distinct set of Filipino meanings and motivations. This phenomenon applies to the goals, beliefs, convictions, and social principles of the traditional value system of the lowland rural family and what Fr. Horacio de la Costa, S.J. calls the Filipino “nationalistic” tradition of individuality, unity, fellowship, and heroism. Garospe (2011), argues that a Filipino value or disvalue does not exist alone, in isolation, or in a vacuum. Filipino values, such as words of honor, shame, unity, and show of power, are clustered around core values such as social acceptance, economic security, and social mobility and are always found in a definite context or set of circumstances. Positive values and negative disvalues together to form a characteristic constellation in school. It differs from the configuration found in government offices, such as unity, heroism, intrigue, a show of power, and bribery. Businesses value and disvalue words of honor, finesse, grease money, and bribery. In barrio or barangays, people value honoring, comforting, cooperation, gratefulness, shame, and show of power. To change a framework of values, the context of these negative values that hinder Filipino and Christian development may need to be changed."

"\n\n4. Filipino values have evolved among our people due to the historical consciousness of values. The concept of justice of the Filipino people has evolved from inequality and the tribe, the family, and the nation to human dignity (Garospe 2011, p. 4). The Filipino consciousness of these different values varies at various periods of our history. The Filipino people became conscious of overpopulation and family planning, environmental pollution, wildlife conservation, violation of human rights (martial law), and active nonviolence of People Power in the past two decades."

"\n\nFilipino Values and Moral Development"

"\n\nIn 1992, Senator Leticia Shahani from the Senate of the Philippines, with the help of Dr. Patricia Licuanan, created a task force to identify Filipino values and moral development. This effort led to the development of “A Moral Recovery Program – Building a People, Building a Nation,” which was submitted to the Philippine Senate. It covers the strengths and weaknesses of Filipino moral characteristics."


"\n\n\nStrengths of the Filipino Character"

Filipinos are very hospitable people. They are also sensitive in dealing with other people. They have a high sense of trust and a remarkable sense of gratitude. They are dependent on interpersonal relationships and give a sense of security, camaraderie, and a feeling of closeness to one another."

"\n\n2. Family Orientation - Filipinos genuinely value and love their family. It is a source of personal identity, emotional and material support, and one’s main commitment and responsibility. Filipinos give honor and respect to parents and elders, care for children, generosity toward kin in need, and endures for the welfare of the family.

"\n\n3. Joy and Humor - Filipinos are cheerful and fun-loving in life through bad and good times.

Laughing at ourselves with the mess we are in is an integral part of our coping mechanism. It manifests in the Filipino’s love for socialization and celebrations even amid most trying times. The result is an emotional balance, optimism, a healthy disrespect for power and office, and a capacity to cope with problems."

"\n\n4. Flexibility, Adaptability, and Creativity - Filipinos can adapt and adjust to any circumstance and environment, both physical and social. They can adjust to whatever unplanned or anticipated events that may arise. Filipinos possess a tolerance for ambiguity that enables us to remain unfazed by uncertainty or lack of information. Filipinos are creative, resourceful, quick learners, can improvise and make use of whatever is at hand to create and produce, accept changes, adapt to life in any part of the world, and make new things out of old scraps. Creative in the cultural sphere, the results of these characteristics of Filipinos are productivity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and equanimity."

"\n\n5. Hard Work and Industry - Filipinos have a sense of hard work. Filipinos use this characteristic to raise life from one’s standard of living into a higher state of living. Filipinos are willing to take risks to work abroad; when given an opportunity, they get a part-time job for an extra income."

"\n\n6. Faith and Religiosity - Filipinos are very religious people. Their innate religiosity enables them to understand and genuinely accept reality according to the will of God. Religious expressions are noticeably expressed every day. They frequently offer prayers and adorations, such as to thank or ask for guidance or forgiveness. These can be observed during fiestas and other special occasions. During calamities, Filipinos are very resilient and establish a positive outlook in life.
