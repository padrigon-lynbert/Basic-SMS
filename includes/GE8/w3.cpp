cout<<"Culture and Personal Behavior"

"\n\nEarlier, we discussed the foundation of morality that is occasionally affected by differences in culture. Reflection in various forms of social life, which societies found acceptable, has been a source of skepticism. Considering various radical differences in social systems, each society thinks differently about the moral and political questions. Hence, how does culture differ from each other and affect various moral values?"

"\n\nCulture - It is the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group."

"\n\nCulture Relativism and Moral Codes"

"\n\n\"“The idea of universal truth in ethics is a myth.\" (Batangas State University, n.d.)"

"\n\n\"The customs of different societies are all that exist.\" (Batangas State University, n.d.)"

"\n\nTo say that a custom is \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" would imply that we can judge that custom by independent standards of right and wrong, but no such standard exists. (Batangas State University, n.d.)"

"\n\nClaims of Culture Relativists"

"\n\nDifferent societies have varying moral codes."

"\n\n\"The moral code of a society determines what is right or wrong within that society.\" (Crotty, 2014)"

"\n\nNo moral truths hold for all people at all times."

"\n\nThe moral code of our society has no special status; it is only one of many moral codes."

"\n\nWe are arrogant when we judge other cultures. We should always be tolerant of other cultures."

"\n\nWhat if the norms of a society favor intolerance?"

"\n\n\"Given that cultural relativists take pride in their tolerance, it would be ironic if their theory supports the intolerance of warlike societies. However, cultural relativism indicates that the norms of culture are supreme within the bounds of the culture itself.\" (Crotty, 2014)"

"\n\nCultural Differences Argument"

"\n\nDifferent cultures have various moral codes. Therefore, morality has no objective “truth.” Right and wrong are only matters of opinion, which vary from culture to culture."

"\n\n\"This is NOT a sound argument. The conclusion does not follow from the premise. The premise concerns what people believe, while the conclusion focuses on what is the case.\" (Crotty, 2014)"

"\n\nConsider this argument:"

"\n\nIn several societies, people believe the Earth is flat, while others believe it is spherical."

"\n\nIt does not follow that there is no “objective truth” in geography because some people disagree."

"\n\nThere is no reason to think that if there is moral truth, then everyone must know it."

"\n\nWhat Follows If Cultural Relativism Is True?"

"\n\nWe could no longer say that the customs of other societies are morally inferior to our own."

"\n\nWe could no longer justifiably criticize the code of our society."

"\n\nThe idea of moral progress is called into doubt."

"\n\nWhy there is Less Disagreement than it Seems"

"\n\nThe difference is in our belief systems, not our values."

"\n\nWe cannot conclude that our values differ because our customs also vary."

"\n\nThe difference in customs may be due to something else."

"\n\nConsider Eskimo infanticide"

"\n\nSuppose we ask why the Eskimos did this."

"\n\nEven in the best of times, a mother can only sustain a few children."

"\n\nAs hunters (primary food providers), boys were favored, and hunters suffered a high casualty rate."

"\n\nIf not for female infanticide, there would be approximately 1 ½-fold more females in the average Eskimo local group as the food-producing males."

"\n\nLife forced choices upon them that we do not have to make."

"\n\nSeveral Values Are Shared by All Cultures"

"\n\nAny culture that continues to exist must care for its young. Infants who are not cared for must be the exception rather than the rule."

"\n\nEvery society must also value truthfulness."

"\n\nSome prohibition against murder is also a necessary feature of any society if it is to persist."

"\n\nJudging a Cultural Practice to Be Undesirable"

"\n\nIs There a Culture-Independent Standard of Right and Wrong?"

"\n\nThis is a standard that might reasonably be used in thinking about any social practice."

"\n\nDoes the practice promote or hinder the welfare of the people affected by it?"

"\n\nThis seems like an independent moral standard that cultural relativism says cannot exist. It is a single standard that may be brought to bear in judging the practices of any culture at any time, including our own."

"\n\nWhat We Can Learn from Cultural Relativism"

"\n\nCultural relativism rightly warns us about the danger of assuming that all our preferences are based on absolute rational standard."

"\n\nCultural relativism urges us to keep an open mind regarding the practices of our culture and the cultures of other societies."

"\n\nThese are important points, but we can accept them without accepting the whole theory.” (Crotty, 2014)\n\n"<<endl;
