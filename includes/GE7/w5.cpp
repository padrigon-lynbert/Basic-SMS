cout<<"Human Flourishing in Terms of Science, Technology, and Society"
"\nnOne of the most significant thinkers and the most accomplished individuals who has ever lived is Aristotle (384-322 B.C.). An enormous debt is owed by every person currently living in Western civilization to Aristotle, who is the fountainhead behind every achievement of aesthetic (especially Romantic art), political theory, science, and technology in the world today. Aristotle's philosophy has underpinned the achievements of the Renaissance and all scientific advances and technological progress to this very day. "

"\n\nThe understandability of the good for Aristotle is based in the idea of what is good for the specific entity under consideration. The good, therefore, for whatever has a natural function, is thought to reside in the function. Through its natural end that the natural function of a thing is determined. With respect to living things, there are particular ways of being that constitute the perfection of the living thing's nature."


"\n\n\nAn end of all of the actions that we perform which we desire for its own sake is present, according to Aristotle. This is known as happiness, flourishing, or eudaimonia, which is desired for its own sake, with all other things being desired on its account. When considered as a whole, eudaimonia is a property of one’s life. On the other hand, the highest good of human endeavors and that toward which all actions aim is called flourishing. As a human being, it is a success. One of excellent human activity is the best life."


"\n\n\nFor Aristotle, the good is what is good for purposeful and goal-directed entities. He defines the good proper to human beings as the activities in which the life functions specific to human beings are most fully realized. In the eyes of Aristotle, the good of each species is teleologically immanent to that species. Guidance and respect to how a person should live his life is provided by the person’s nature as a human being. The existence of individual human beings each with his own rational mind and free will is a fundamental fact of human nature. A person's distinctive capacity and means of survival is the use of one’s volitional consciousness."


"\n\n\nConducting rational research with respect to value is something that Aristotle thought was possible. He saw practical science as an essentially moral or evaluative science. Practical science takes into account the ethical aspects of the subject being studied, thus, to an extent, is ethical. "


"\n\n\nAristotle regarded reality as ordered. He also taught that with respect to human affairs, order is an effort or project through which people aspire to happiness through the cultivation of virtues. The end of politics being the good for man is an idea that he asserts. According to him, the virtue of prudence is freely pursued, personal, and changeable according to situations. For one individual, a prudent action they do may not be considered as a prudent action for another person or individual. Nevertheless, the integration of freely made prudent and varying actions results in social coordination. Aristotle believed that economic coordination can be attained when persons prudently choose and undertake economic transactions with others. He also believed that a life with other people is required in human flourishing."



"\n\n\n\nTechnology as a Way of Revealing"
"\n\tMartin Heidegger’s Definition of Technology"

"\n\nMartin Heidegger"

         
"\n\nThe problem of technology is approached by Heidegger with the purpose of finding its essence. Reducing technology to its fundamental being is the method. By doing so, all aspects and problems thereof may be understood. Heidegger gives special attention to language. He frequently refers to the Latina and Greek origins of the vocabulary he introduces. He successively reduces the essence of technology to simpler and more basic concepts until its relation to humankind is apparent through this manner. Verbs is what he is particularly fond with. The essence of modern technology becomes a type of happening. Heidegger proceeds to identify the danger and saving power contained therein after he has finished laying bare the nature of modern technology. As the \"later Heidegger\", Heidegger believes truth to be better approachable through art and poetry, rather than by science or logic. He also believes that the essence of the salvation of technology is art. The article’s rhetorical form is to carefully characterize modern technology as a seemingly insoluble problem, and then later finding the solution in the very definition of the problem."


"\n\nA series of definitions that correspond to the steps in which Heidegger strips technology down to its essence is involved in the explication of his reduction of technology."

"\n\nInstrumentality: an instrument to achieve human ends, specifically those of arranging or building up, is called technology"

"\n\nTechnology is slipping out of control and its nature as an instrument causes frustration and excites the will to re-master it, which is a large factor in the growing discomfort with modern technology."


"\n\nCausality: instruments are designed for the purpose of causing an end."

"\n\nWhen one takes deeper look into causality, it reveals that the end is actually the beginning. This means that it is a cause that to which something is indebted and the purpose for which an instrument is designed is the primary cause of its coming into being. To an occasioning, the essence of causality is reduced. This occasioning is a bringing forth into presencing of something which is not presencing, the Greek poiesis."


"\n\n\nRevealing: something is brought forth only when it passes from concealment into unconcealment; when it is revealed."

"\n\nRevealing, as claimed by Heidegger, is what \"truth\" really means. Aletheia, the Greek for revealing, is translated by the Romans into veritas, truth. Pertinent to the understanding of the danger of technology is the equating of revealing with truth."


"\n\n\nThe Danger"
"\n\nNow, Heidegger separates modern technology from previous technology and also specifies its peculiar type of revealing. He shows this to be a danger to humankind. Modern physics, an exact science, is what modern technology is based on. It is different from previous technology as it does not humble itself to natural forces such as the windmill to wind. Rather, it is through physics that we can know the energy stored in nature and we can set upon nature and challenge it to release this energy. We dam rivers and mine coal, thereby we control resources, not merely harvest them. Thus, objects become standing-reserve, ready to be ordered about by humans."


"\n\nHowever, humans are not the masters. Revealing itself is not controlled by us. The \"real shows itself or withdraws.\" Beyond humans, revealing does not occur, but also not decisively or exclusively in us. Thus we respond to \"that challenging claim which gathers man thither to order the self-revealing as standing-reserve.\" In this way, we ourselves as humans are standing reserve, being challenged to set upon all things, including ourselves, that they may be ready to be ordered about. The essence of modern technology is this form of revealing. Heidegger refers to it as Enframing. Revealing is not only a bringing forth, it is a destining. Here, revealing brings forth; revealing also starts upon its way. What destines us into the process of Enframing is the revealing to us of Enframing. And with this, the danger lies."


"\n\nDanger to humankind’s freedom is this danger. For Heidegger, \"freedom is the realm of the destining that at any given time starts a revealing upon its way.\" Simply put, freedom is that revealing that destines us to more revealings. It is the revealing of the veil from under which revealing comes, as a veil. And to more simply put it, it is the revealing of the fact that there are more revealings possible."


"\n\nEnframing destines us to Enframe. A decisive role in Enframing is what appears to be something we have, to the point that we see ourselves as the masters of the world and the orderers of standing-reserve. In fact, we are but one standing-reserve ordering others because we are employed merely to the purpose of creating standing-reserve. When governing our activity is this purpose, we become so engrossed in ordering and securing standing-reserve that it comes to a point that we do not recognize Enframing as a revealing. We, thus, lose the awareness of our capacity for revelation. All objects become forms of standing-reserve, and we feel that we encounter only ourselves, but in fact, we do not encounter our essence, because this essence is revelation. Recall that the revealing of the possibility of more revealings is freedom. We lose this also when lose all awareness of revealing in general. Blindly challenging and ordering standing-reserves is something we continue to do."


"\n\n\nThe Saving Power"
"\nhe essence of technology, which threatens the loss of what is most essentially human, which is our capacity for new revealings, poses extreme danger to humankind. The essence of technology is the revealing of Enframing. Through that, the essence of technology is a permanent enduring in the sense of Plato's Ideas (or Forms). Heidegger returns again to language and notes that Goethe once equated to endure (währen) with to grant (gewähren). He claims \"that which endures most primally out of the earliest beginning is what grants.\" Although enframing presents the extreme danger of making impossible other destining revealings, it is also a granting. As such, it gives humankind what we need, but cannot make: a part in the \"coming-to-pass of truth.\" It is a type of revealing. Enframing is also seen as it contains the saving power which is the granting of revealing. Technology’s coming to presence, as opposed to the material products of technology’s material products, is what we must pay attention to. By doing so, we may see the process of revealing as opposed to the standing-reserve as which technology causes things to reveal themselves."

"\n\nLooking into the extreme danger is where the saving power lies. We must look past the technological toward the essence of technology, the destining revealing that endangers our freedom. The arising of the saving power in this essence is the fact that it shows us that mankind belongs to revealing, to the coming to presence of truth. Part of the constellation of unconcealment and concealment, wherein truth comes to presence, is the essence of technology. However, the sight of the saving power is not the same as being saved. In addition to looking into the danger, Heidegger suggests a more tangible path to salvation.\n\n"<<endl;
