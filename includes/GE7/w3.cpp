cout<<"Scientific Revolution"

"\n\nThe scientific revolution was built upon the foundation of ancient Greek learning and science in the Middle Ages, as it had been elaborated and further developed by Roman/Byzantine science and medieval Islamic science. In the 17th century, natural philosophers had moved away from much of the Aristotelian tradition, but it was still an important intellectual framework at that time. Key scientific ideas that date back to classical antiquity had changed drastically over the years, and in fact, in many cases, had even been discredited. During the scientific revolution, the ideas that remained transformed fundamentally."


"\n\n\nThe change to the medieval idea of science occurred for four reasons:"

"\n\n17th century philosophers and scientists were able to collaborate with members of the astronomical and mathematical communities to affect advances in all fields."

"\n\nThe inadequacy of medieval experimental methods for scientists’ works were realized by them. Thus, the need to devise new methods was felt by them (some of which we use today)."

"\n\nA legacy of Middle Eastern, Greek, and European scientific philosophy can be access by Academics. They could use this as a starting point (either by disproving or building on the theorems)."

"\n\nIt is the institutions (e.g. the British Royal Society) that helped validate science as a field by providing an outlet for the publication of works of scientists."


"\n\n\nNew Ideas"

"\n\nIn what is called as the scientific revolution, many ideas are contributed to it. Some of them were even revolutions in their own fields. These include:"

"\n\nThe heliocentric model. This involved the radical displacement of the earth to an orbit around the sun (as opposed to being seen as the center of the universe). To demonstrate that the center of the universe was the sun, Copernicus used his 1543 heliocentric model of the solar system. Credibility was given to the theory due to the discoveries of Galileo and Johannes Kepler, and as well as the work culminated in Isaac Newton’s Principia. This work formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation which dominated the views of scientists on the physical universe for the next three centuries."


"\n\n\nStudying human anatomy based upon the dissection of human corpses. This is as opposed to animal dissections, which was practiced for centuries. Discovering and studying electricity and magnetism and consequently, various materials’ electric properties. Modernization of disciplines (making them more as what they are today), including chemistry, optics, dentistry, or physiology."


"\n\n\nThe invention of tools that helped deepen the understating of sciences, such as the mechanical calculator, refracting and reflecting telescopes, steam digester (the forerunner of the steam engine), mercury barometer, or vacuum pump."


"\n\n\nThe Thinker: Nicolaus Copernicus"
"\n\tAs mentioned earlier, the man who arguably began this revolution was the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Born in Thorn in 1473, Copernicus studied in Krakow, Bologna, Padua and Rome before returning to Warmia, Poland to teach and study for the remainder of his life."


"\n\n\nFor nearly his entire life, Copernicus worked on a heliocentric model - where the sun, and not the Earth, was the center of the solar system. Unlike previous mathematicians and astronomers who used heliocentric models to make their mathematical calculations of the planet's orbits more accurate, Copernicus firmly and genuinely believed that the sun was at the center of the solar system. However, Copernicus chose to wait to publish his calculations and theories shortly until before his death likely because of fears of potential backlash from church authorities. Regardless of the errors and discrepancies in his final theory, his greatest and most notable achievement was the removal of the Earth from the center of the universe and solar system."




"\n\n\n\nCharles Darwin and his Theory of Evolution"
"\n\tOne of the most celebrated and eminent scientists of the past few centuries is Charles Robert Darwin (February 12, 1809 – April 19, 1882. His theory of evolution by the means of natural selection is his broadest and most notable influence. During Darwin’s voyage on the HMS Beagle (1831–1836), he made remarkable insights and investigations that led him to develop revolutionary ideas related to adaptation and speciation and to theorize about concepts of evolutionary biology. Although previous scientific thinkers had laid down some of the foundations for Darwin’s work, and others later expanded upon and more fully developed the scientific bases for his conclusions, Darwin set forth and formulated the controversial but coherent ideas about organic evolution that have impacted the world at large. His groundbreaking “On the Origin of Species” was originally published in 1859. Darwin argued later on in 1871 in “The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex” that just as other organisms had, humans had evolved, which created a storm of controversy that continues up until this day."


"\n\nThe core insights of Darwin regarding natural selection have proven profound and inspirational. Often, organisms tend to produce more progeny than the environment will allow to subsist in the process of natural selection. In the struggle for existence that ensues, progeny with favorable variations in their traits will survive and leave more offspring than others do; the favorable variations accumulate through subsequent generations, and descendants with a set of adaptations to their environment eventually diverge from their less adapted ancestors. In working from this basic foundation of evolution through natural selection, modern investigators and scientists have been able to formulate more specific ideas and principles relating to many topics. "


"\n\n\n\nSigmund Freud: Life, Work, and Theories"
"\n\tFreud entered the University of Vienna medical school in 1873. Later on in 1882, he worked as a clinical assistant at the General Hospital in Vienna and trained with Theodor Meynert, a psychiatrist, and Hermann Nothnagel, a professor of internal medicine. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, Freud had completed research on the brain’s medulla and was then appointed as a lecturer in neuropathology by 1885."


"\n\nJosef Breuer is Freud’s friend, a physician, and a physiologist. The course of Freud's career was impacted largely by Breuer. Breuer told his friend about using hypnosis to cure a patient, Bertha Pappenheim (referred to as Anna O.), of what was then called hysteria. Breuer would hypnotize her, and she was able to talk about things that she would not be able to remember in a conscious state. Afterwards, her symptoms were relieved. This has become known as the \"talking cure.\" Freud then travelled to Paris to study further under Jean-Martin Charcot, a neurologist that is famous for using hypnosis to treat hysteria."


"\n\nAfter this new line of study, in 1886 Freud returned to his hometown and opened a practice that specialized in brain and nervous disorders. He found that hypnosis did not work as well as he had hoped. Instead, a new way to get people to talk freely was developed by him. He would have patients lie back on a couch to ensure that they were comfortable and then would tell them to talk about whatever popped into their head. Whatever the person would say would be written down by Freud and then analyzed. This method of treatment is called free association. In a paper called Studien über Hysterie (Studies in Hysteria), Freud published his findings alongside Breuer in 1895."


"\n\nIt was in 1896 when the term psychoanalysis was coined by Freud. This is the treatment of mental disorders, with an emphasis on the unconscious mental processes. It is also called \"depth psychology.\" Freud also developed what he thought of as the three agencies of the human personality: the id, ego, and superego. The id is the primitive instincts, like aggression and sex. On the other hand, the ego is the \"self\" part of the personality that interacts with the world in which the person lives in. The superego is the part of the personality that is ethical and creates the moral standards for the ego. One of the most influential scientists in the fields of psychiatry and psychology was Sigmund Freud. And although it has been over 100 years since Freud published his theories, he still manages to influence what we think about the mind and personality."


"\n\n\nCradles of Early Science"

"\n\nMesoamerica"
"\n\tAlong the southwestern curve of the Gulf of Mexico, near the present city of Veracruz, the founding culture of Mesoamerica appeared. The Olmecs (the “rubber people”) culture lasted from about 1400 BCE to 100 BCE. It produced nearly imperishable art, notably large carved heads of volcanic rock, the largest weighing some 20 tons and standing about 10 feet tall. Typically, an indication of a civilization with powerful leaders is the presence of monumental tombs or sculptures. Instead of one big empire, the Maya organized themselves into small city-states. The most sophisticated and elaborate writing system of the several different ones used in Mesoamerica was also developed by them. Mayan writing included both symbols and pictographs for syllables."


"\n\nMaya shaman/priests worked out remarkable systems of mathematics and cosmology. Three kinds of calendars were devised by them. A calendar of the solar year of 365 days governed the agricultural cycle and a calendar of the ritual year of 260 days dictated daily affairs; these two calendars coincided every 52 years. A third calendar, called the Long Count calendar, extended back to the date August 13, 3114 BCE (on the Gregorian calendar), to record the large-scale passage of time. The Maya calculated a solar year as 365.242 days, about 17 seconds shorter than the figures of modern astronomers. They also introduced the concept of zero; the first evidence of zero as a number dates from 357 BCE, but it may go back further, to Olmec times. In Afro-Eurasia, Hindu scholars first represented zero in the 800s CE."


"\n\n\nAsia"
"\n\tEarly evidence for Chinese millet agriculture is dated to around 7000 BCE, with the earliest evidence of cultivated rice found at Chengtoushan near the Yangtze River, dated to 6500 BCE. Chengtoushan may also be the site of the first walled city in China. This Neolithic Revolution gave rise to the Jiahu culture (7000 to 5800 BCE). There are even some scholars that have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (6600 BCE) are the earliest form of proto-writing in China. "

"\n\nChinese civilization begins during the second phase of the Erlitou period (1900 to 1500 BCE), with Erlitou considered the first state level society of East Asia. Erlitou saw an increase in bronze metallurgy and urbanization and was a rapidly growing regional center with palatial complexes that provide evidence for social stratification. The earliest traditional Chinese dynasty for which there is both archeological and written evidence is the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BCE). Shang sites have yielded the earliest known body of Chinese writing, the oracle bone script, mostly divinations inscribed on bones. These inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of Chinese civilization. The Sanxingdui culture is another Chinese Bronze Age society, contemporaneous to the Shang dynasty, however they developed a different method of bronze-making from the Shang."


"\n\n\nMiddle East"
"\n\nBaghdad, the capital of this empire, was established on the Tigris River. Due to its location, it became a natural crossroads that the East and West could meet. Quickly, Baghdad became a major cultural centre. Important Indian and Greek mathematical books were translated and studied, leading to a new era of scientific creativity that was to last until the 14th century. "


"\n\nThe 9th century scholar Abu Ja'far Mohammed ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi, an astronomer to the caliph at Baghdad, is one of the earliest and most distinguished of the Arabic mathematicians. His full name can be translated as \"Father of Ja'far, Mohammed, son of Moses, native of the town of Al-Khwarizmi.\" Al-Khwarizmi wrote several enormously influential books. One, in particular, describes how to write numbers and compute with them using the place-value decimal system we use today, which had been developed in India some time before 600 AD. This book would, when translated into Latin 300 years later, prove a major source for Europeans who wanted to learn the new system. Today, we know it as the Hindu-Arabic system. It is taught to schoolchildren worldwide."


"\n\n\nAfrica"
"\n\tThe Lebombo Bone discovered between South Africa and Swaziland is dated back to about 37,000 years before the present era. According to scientists, it could be a lunar calendar, specifying the number of days in a lunar month, similar in principle to the notches calendar used today by the San people in Namibia. This is the first visible sign of the emergence of mathematical calculations in the history of humanity, as reflected by the Anglo-Saxon researcher Richard Mankiewicz in his book L’histoire des mathématiques – Paris, Seuil, 2001. The first certain trace of the existence and the mastery of agriculture comes from Nubia (Sudan). The work of Professor Fred Wendorf admitted today that at least 14,000 years ago, the African man was the first to master agriculture and techniques.\n\n"<<endl;
