cout<<"Indigenous Science and Technology in the Philippines"

"\n\nWhen Spain had already colonized most lowland communities in the Philippines in the 1700s, the indigenous peoples in the Philippines continued to live in their isolated and self-sufficient communities. They were able to preserve the culture and traditions of their \"ethnos\" or \"tribe\" as reflected in their communal views on land, their cooperative work exchanges, their communal rituals, their songs, dances, and folklore."

"\n\nThe knowledge of the indigenous people of native science and the environment has been instrumental in our modern scientific advancements. Their knowledge has evolved from prolonged interactions with nature and has provided valuable resources for appropriate technology development and discoveries. People who practiced indigenous science used science process skills guided by community culture and values composed of traditional knowledge. Their scientific advancements have helped people in understanding the natural environment and in coping with everyday life. This Indigenous Knowledge System is defined by the cultural traditions of local communities, which are orally passed in stories, poems, and songs."

"\n\n\nExamples of Indigenous knowledge that are taught and practiced by indigenous Filipinos are:"

"\n\nPrediction of weather. The unusual behavior of insects, such as ants, earthworms,  and dragonflies,  has become a basis for predicting an upcoming rain, typhoon, or bad weather."
"\n\nUsing herbal medicine. Tamarind leaves, for example, are used as a cure for cough and cold by boiling young leaves for 30 minutes to drink."
"\n\nPreserving foods. Salting, as also practiced until today, is one of the indigenous practices in preserving food with dry edible salt. This method is done so that food will not be easily spoiled."
"\n\nClassifying plants and animals into families. Philippine languages have specific names for specific organisms."
"\n\nSelecting good seeds for planting. Indigenous Filipinos learned to choose good seeds from the bad ones to maximize plant yield."
"\n\nUsing indigenous technology (pottery, weaving, and fine metalcraft). Examples of traditional outputs from weaving include placemats, bags, wallets, and mats. Indigenous Filipino metalsmiths can make intricate gold and bronze jewelry."
"\n\nBuilding local irrigation. Indigenous practice includes pulling up water from a well or other such source to irrigate the land to keep plants healthy even if there's a dry spell."
"\n\nClassifying different types of soil for planting."
"\n\nProducing wines from tropical fruits. The Kalinga Women produced fruit wines from Guyabano and bignay."
"\n\nKeeping the custom of growing plants and vegetables."


"\n\nIndigenous knowledge, also known as Traditional Ecological Knowledge, is handed down through generations by Indigenous people. It helps us understand environmental change, wildlife population monitoring, sustainable harvesting practices, behavioral ecology, ecological relationships, and so much more. (Popp, 2018)"


"\n\n\n\nScience and technology in the Philippines at Present"
 

"\n\nThe Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in the Philippines, with its mandate from Executive Order No. 128, is a government agency tasked with overseeing and managing national technology development and acquisition, undertaking technological and scientific research, and promoting public consciousness of science and technology."


"\n\nThe country's performance in achieving the desired outcomes for the science, technology, and innovation (STI) sector has been moderate. The latest available data indicate that four out of nine targets with available data have been exceeded."

 

"\n\n\nOver the decade, the Philippines have reported breakthroughs in scientific discoveries and inventions, including"

"\n\nThe discovery of the ancient human species called Homo luzonensis in Callao Cave;"
"\n\nThe launch of the Philippines first microsatellite Diwata-1;"
"\n\nThe invention of environment-friendly lamps that run on saltwater, such as the SALt lamp and the Liter of Light Project, has helped light poor communities with no access to electricity.\n\n"<<endl;
