cout<<"History of Science and Technology in Ancient Cultures"

"\n\nThe study of protoscience in ancient history refers to the history of science in early cultures, which was before the development of science in the Middle Ages. In prehistoric times, advice and knowledge were passed from generation to generation in an oral tradition. The development of writing systems allowed various societies to store and communicate knowledge. Currently, we are still reaping the benefits of recorded knowledge as we are still discovering ancient evidence of scientific advances."

"\n\nWriting coexisted with the development of agriculture. It allowed for a surplus of food, which made it possible for early civilizations to develop. They were able to dedicate more time to do tasks other than survival, such as searching for knowledge for knowledge’s sake."


"\n\n\nMesopotamia"

"\n\nThe Mesopotamian civilization developed around 3500 BC in Sumer, now known as the country Iraq. The Mesopotamian people recorded some observations about the world using extremely detailed numerical data. An example would be the records of Pythagoras’ law on the Mesopotamian cuneiform tablet, which dates back to as early as the 18th century BC."

"\n\nAstronomy is a science that focuses on recording and studying observations on the heavenly bodies. The Mesopotamian scribes left vigorous notes on the motions of the stars, planets, and the moon in thousands of clay tablets."


"\n\n\nAncient Egypt"

"\n\nAncient Egypt developed their scientific knowledge in astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. Geometry developed when there was a need to layout the beginning and end of certain privately-owned farmland. Marking the perimeter of farmlands was also necessary to prepare these lands for the Nile River’s annual flood. Rules of geometry such as the 3-4-5 right triangle and other rules of thumb were developed to represent rectangular structures, including reinforcing structural posts and openings. Egypt also became a center of alchemical research in the ancient western world."

"\n\nThe phonetic writing system known as the Egyptian hieroglyphs served as the basis for the Egyptian Phoenician alphabet. Later on, the Egyptian Phoenician alphabet evolved into Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, and Cyrillic alphabets. The city of Alexandria retained superiority with its library, which was entirely destroyed by fire when it fell under Roman rule before 642. With it, a great amount of antique literature and knowledge was lost."

"\n\nOne of the first medical documents still surviving is the Edwin Smith papyrus. It is perhaps the earliest record that attempts to describe and analyze the brain: it might be seen as the beginning of modern neuroscience."


"\n\n\nPersia"

"\n\nIn the Sassanid period (226 to 652 AD), the Persians gave great attention to mathematics and astronomy. A prominent example is the Academy of Gundishapur. Astronomical tables, such as the Shahryar Tables, are still used to this period. On the other hand, Muslim astronomers and astrologers of the Islamic period later imitated the Sassanid observatory. In the mid-Sassanid era, in the form of views and traditions of Greece, an influx of knowledge came to Persia from the West. Following the spread of Christianity, it accompanied Syriac, the official language of Christians and the Iranian Nestorians. The Christian schools in Iran produced great scientists such as Nersi, Farhad, and Marabai. Paulus Persa, head of the Iranian Department of Logic and Philosophy of Aristotle, also left a book written in Syriac and dictated to Sassanid King Anushiravan. Persia became a stronghold of Islamic science in the Early Middle Ages."


"\n\n\nGreco-Roman World"

"\n\nScientific thought in Classical Antiquity became more practical from the 6th century BC in pre-Socratic philosophy, headlined by Thales and Pythagoras. In 385 BC, Plato founded the Academy, where his students participated in the “scientific revolution” of the Hellenistic period using discourse. Scholars would discuss some practical issues by using a conversational and reasoning process. These scholars include Eratosthenes, Euclid, Aristarchus of Samos, Hipparchus, and Archimedes. (3rd to 2nd centuries)"

"\n\nIn Classical Antiquity, a reliable calendar, cures for various illnesses, and abstract thought experiments known as natural philosophy were developed. These developments resulted from wondering how the universe works while practicing a skilled profession (for example, physicians), generating rational thinking through discourse, or following religious traditions (temple healers)."

"\n\nThere are important legacies from this period. First are advances in factual knowledge, specifically in anatomy, zoology, botany, mineralogy, geography, mathematics, and astronomy. Second is the awareness of the importance of some scientific issues, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes. Finally, a recognition of the methodological significance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research."


"\n\n\nIndia"

"\n\nExcavations at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, and other sites in the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) have uncovered evidence of the use of practical mathematics. To develop building blocks that would make dwellings more durable, the people of the IVC manufactured bricks whose dimensions were in proportion 4:2:1. This meant that they found a way to compute bricks' dimensions to support a given weight by developing standard ratios. They mass-produced weights in regular geometrical shapes, including hexahedra, barrels, cones, and cylinders, thereby demonstrating basic knowledge of geometry."

"\n\nThe inhabitants of the Indus civilization also tried to standardize the measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy. They designed a ruler — the Mohenjo-daro ruler — whose unit of length (approximately 1.32 inches or 3.4 centimeters) was divided into ten equal parts. Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length. "

"\n\nAlchemy (Rasaśāstra in Sanskrit) was popular in India. The Indian alchemist and philosopher Kanada introduced the concept of ‘anu’, which he defined as matter that cannot be subdivided. This thinking is analogous to the concept of the atom in modern science."


"\n\n\nChina"
"\n\nThe first recorded observations of solar eclipses and supernovae were discovered in China. Chinese astronomers observed a supernova guest star, the remnant now known as the Crab Nebula on July 4, 1054. There are similar records from Korean contributions, including records of meteor showers and eclipses, particularly from 1500-1750 in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty. Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture, and herbal medicine were also practiced, with similar medicine practiced in Korea."

"\n\n\nThe abacus, the public toilet, and the “shadow clock” were few of the earliest inventions. However, Joseph Needham noted the “Four Great Inventions” of China — the compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and printing — as among the most critical technological advances. In particular, the Chinese developed many innovations in the Tang dynasty (AD 618 - 906). Later, up to the Qing Dynasty, an exchange of ideas occurred between Europeans and Chinese. These inventions were adopted in Europe at the end of the Middle Ages."


"\n\n\nHistory of Science and Technology in Medieval Ages"

"\n\nThe Middle Ages (500 to 1400) is now considered a period with limited scientific advances in Europe. Still, modern scholars regard this period as the Golden Age of Islam and the enlightenment of the Byzantine Empire."

"\n\nWhen the civilization of Rome became powerless, Europe had to adjust by keeping peace and empire-building. Europeans did not have enough time and resources to develop scientific learning. Despite this, Charlemagne tried to establish a learning tradition by assigning scribes to record known knowledge. The later Middle Ages saw advancements in the philosophy of science and the development of the scientific method."

"\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, many historians and scientists regard Western Europe as entirely devoid of interest in scientific discovery. Contemptuously, the Romans caused medieval Europe to fall into the Dark Ages, a period when there was a rise of many unhealthy and illiterate peasants and rulers. Superstition reemerged in Western Europe, regressing from the scientific progress brought about by the Greek and Roman ages of reason and high philosophy."


"\n\n\nhe Dark Ages"

"\n\nSome historians believe that Europe regressed into war and barbarism during the Dark Ages because of the severe inequality and lack of scientific advancement in the previous period. To keep the peace, the Christian Church became more controlling, further stifling scientific development."

"\n\nSome historians have the opposing view because the lack of written records on scientific development from the Dark Ages does not mean that there were no scientific advancements. The Dark Ages were only relatively slow in progress compared to the Roman Empire’s focus on meticulous record-keeping. Developments in science can be seen in the Middle East instead of Europe. Modern scholars now regard this period as the Golden Age of Islam and the enlightenment of the Byzantine Empire outside of Europe."


"\n\n\nEarly Medieval Society - The Dark Ages after the Collapse of Rome"

"\n\nThe Early Medieval period (about AD 500 to 1000) in Europe is regarded as the real Dark Ages. In this period, medieval society fell into barbarism and ignorance. As records show, Norse sailors could not develop the compass as early as the Chinese did. Still, they were master navigators and could use the stars and a few instruments to navigate to Iceland, Greenland, and Vinland."

"\n\nHowever, monastic study was able to keep some of the scientific processes alive, even if records were confined to the Bible’s content.  To cure the sick, the monks of Western Europe studied medicine. To set dates for church holidays such as Easter, the monks observed the stars and developed the discipline of astronomy. Monks and scribes preserved the rules of mathematics and geometry when analyzing the movements of the heavenly bodies."


"\n\n\nThe Middle Ages - Charlemagne, Science, and Learning"

"\n\nDuring the 9th Century, these small embers of preserved knowledge leaped to life. As Western Europeans tried to systemize education, rulers and church leaders realized that education was the key to maintaining unity and peace. This period, known as the Carolingian Renaissance, was when Charles the Great, often known as Charlemagne, tried to reestablish knowledge as a cornerstone of medieval society. Although he is often depicted as the Golden Hero of the Church, he was a brutal man of war. More importantly, he was a great believer in the power of learning. While using the Catholic Church to transmit knowledge and education, he instigated a revival in art, culture, and learning. He ordered the translation of many Latin texts to Middle English. Charlemagne also promoted astronomy, a field that he loved to study, despite his inability to read. As medieval society transitioned into the High Middle Ages, the teaching of logic, philosophy, and theology enhanced the thinking process of some Christian thinkers in Western Europe."


"\n\n\nThe High Middle Ages - The Rebirth of Science and Scholasticism"

"\n\nFrom 1000 until 1300, this era saw Western Europe, from Ireland to Italy and from Denmark to Spain, begin to slowly crawl out of the endless warring as populations grew and the shared Christian identity gave some unity of purpose. Because trading and sharing ideas were common, ideas from Moorish Spain, the Holy Land, and Byzantiumwere were brought back by merchants and mercenaries. Many of the Ancient Greek texts were translated into Arabic by the Muslims. In the middle of the 11th Century, these books were translated from Arabic to Latin by scholars from all around Europe who flocked to Spain. This translation process provided a conduit for the Greeks' knowledge to pass into Europe, where the schools set up by Charlemagne were now growing into universities. Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114-1187), and many other scholars learned Arabic so that they may complete their task."

"\n\nCenters of learning, known as the Studium Generale, sprang up across Western Europe by the 12th Century. This drew scholars away from the Ancient Greeks' knowledge and combining Classical Antiquity’s discoveries with the great Muslim philosophers' and scientists' findings. This period did not see the Greeks, Romans, Chinese, Persians, or Muslims' significant technological advances. Still, the contribution of great thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, Grosseteste, Francis Bacon, and William of Ockham to the creation of the Scientific Method cannot be underestimated."

"\n\nAquinas and Grosseteste are considered to be the Fathers of Scholasticism and the Scientific Method. While they were more interested in using philosophy to prove the existence of God, Thomas Aquinas oversaw a shift from Platonic reasoning towards Aristotelian empiricism. Meaning, Aquinas became an expert in reasoning by citing evidence using the senses. One of the significant contributors to the scientific method, Robert Grosseteste, founded the Oxford Franciscan School. He also began to promote the dualistic scientific method, which was first proposed by Aristotle."

"\n\nGrosseteste’s idea of resolution and composition involved experimentation and prediction. He firmly believed that to propose a universal law, observations should be used. It is this universal law that should be used to predict outcomes. This idea was very similar to the concept of ancient astronomers. They used observations to discern trends, and then used these trends to create predictive models for astronomical events."

"\nRoger Bacon, also known as the Shining Light of Science in Medieval Society, is one of the great minds behind the development of the scientific method. The scientific method was also improved through the learnings of Aristotle, Avicenna, Galileo, and Newton. Bacon took the work of Grosseteste, Aristotle, and the Islamic alchemists to propose the idea of induction as the cornerstone of empiricism. Empiricism is the philosophy that conclusions should be made with evidence. Bacon described the method of observation, prediction (hypothesis), and experimentation. He also explained that the results should be independently verified, documenting his results in sufficient detail so that others might repeat the experiment."


"\n\n\nThe Late Middle Ages - Scholasticism and the Scientific Method"

"\n\nAs thinkers continued the work of scholasticism, adding to the philosophy underpinning science, the Late Middle Ages (from 1300 until 1500) saw progress speed up. This period made sophisticated observations and theories that were sadly superseded by works of later scientists. Finally, the removal of divine intervention from the process of explaining natural phenomena was sought out by many of the scholastic philosophers. They believed that scholars should look for a more direct and natural cause rather than stating that it must be the work of divine providence."


"\n\n\nThe Black Death - The Destroyer of Medieval Society and Scholasticism"
"\n\nIn favor of the later thinkers that drove the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment, the advances of many of these philosophers and scholars were forgotten and underplayed. The first Renaissance of the Middle Ages was halted by a natural phenomenon, the Black Death. This phenomenon killed over a third of Europeans, especially in the growing urban areas."

"\n\nIt is the mass disruption to medieval society, which was caused by the plague, that set the progress of science and discovery back. These knowledge would not reemerge until the Renaissance.\n\n"<<endl;
