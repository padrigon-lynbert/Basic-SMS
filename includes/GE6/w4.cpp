cout<<"Filipino Artists and Artisans"

"\n\nWe Filipinos can be proud of the craftsmanship of our artisans and the artwork of our artists. However, we can observe that craftspeople and artisans in the Philippines are less popular than mainstream Filipino artists."

"\n\nTo recognize and to honor our Filipino artisans, the National Commission of Culture and the Arts (NCCA) conducts a research, screening, and awarding process of Filipino artist and artisans for their excellent work and representations of our dynamic national indentity. The awards for Filipino artisans is called the Order of the National Artists the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (GAMABA)."


"\n\n\nA. National Artists "

"\n\nThe NCCA inducts Filipino artists in the Order of National Artists from the fields of architecture, cinema, literature, historical literature, visual arts, dance, theater, theater design, music, and fashion design. It honors Filipino artists that contrubute to the national identity through arts and have dedicated their lives to the creation of art. (National Commission for the Culture and the Arts, n.d.)"

"\n\nFashion designer Ramon Valera, filmmakers Lino Brocka and Kidlat Tahimik, composer and musician Ryan Cayabyab, and visual artist Larry Alcala are among those inducted in the Order of National Artists."
		

"\n\n\nB. GAMABA Awardees"

"\n\nThe Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or National Living Treasures Award honor Filipino artisans who have demonstrated technical and artistic expertise on cultural and traditional art. To be awarded the GAMABA award, one must have passed on the craft to the current generation. The current generation must demonstrate the same level of expertise as the National Living Treasure.  (National Commission on the Culture and the Arts, n.d.)"

"\n\nThe awardees of the GAMABA craft music, stories, poetry, handmade woven textiles and mats, and other crafts that show the way of life and culture of different Filipino tribes and groups. The foloowing photos are of GAMABA awardees and their work."
		


"\n\n\nArtist vs. Artisan"

"\nWhy does NCCA have two types of awards? Looking at the awardees of GAMABA and the Order of National Artists, we can see that awardees use different mediums and content. They also differ in the purpose of crafting their work."

"\n\n\nA. Purpose"

"\n\nThe artisan and artist differ in the purpose of creating art. The artisan creates art for a specific social or cultural function. For example, indigenous textile weavers use patterns that are believed to protect the wearer from evil spirits. Additionally, the function of an artisans’ work is to preserve and pass on the culture and way of life to succeeding generation. (Salvador-Amores, 2017)"

"\n\nOn the other hand, artists create art to reflect their idea of reality. The art they make is a \"finished\" work and functions to be shown and interpreted by people who may not be within the social circle or community of the artist. For instance, the artwork of Solenn Heusaff can be interpreted by different people based on the context in which she made the artwork."

"\n\n\nB. Content "

"\n\nAs seen in the works of GAMABA awardees and National Artists, the content of their work also differ. The content of the art of artists are usually the context or immediate environment they are living in, while the content of artisan works are cultural symbols."

"\n\n\nC. Mediums"

"\n\nWe can also see differences in the medium used by artists and artisans. Artists use written literature, built architecture, staged theater, film, music, and visual arts. Artisans use indigenous material, such as grass, and historically-traded material, such as gold and other metals."

"\n\n\nD. Techniques"

"\n\nArtists and artisans also differ in the techniques they use in creating art. Artists use and innovate from techniques taught in art schools. Sometimes, artists create their own technique for creating art. On the other hand, artisans learn the techniques of crafting from their ancestors and seek to preserve such techniques. As a result, artisans prefer to use handmade and indigenous techniques, while artists innovate from tried-and-tested techniques."

"\n\n\nArt Administration"

"\n\nAs seen in the Dayaw episode at the beginning of this lesson, art can change through time. Unfortunately, some indigenous Filipino artisanal skills have almost vanished from our culture. How do we then preserve our way of life through art?"

"\n\nAccording to the NCCA Chair Felipe de Leon (2017), Whang-od is able to continually balance between being a community artisan and being a modern artist. She carries with her the communal Kalinga way of life. The Kalinga’s artisanal skills is preserved through her rising popularity among non-Kalinga Filipinos and foreigners. (National Commission on the Culture and the Arts, 2017) Still, we can observe that the artisanal pieces is negotiating a way to be relevant despite different preferences in form and purpose. Adding to this development are the increasing ease of tourism in the Kalinga and the development of other market aspects."

"\n\nThe process of bringing community artisans's work and artists's work to a wider audience is called art administration or art management. As a business venture, art administration makes sure that resources are available for the production of art while providing artists a chance to work creatively. Most of these resources come from art patrons and buyers. (International Studies in History and Business of Art & Culture, n.d.)"

"\n\n\nAspects of the Art Market"

"\n\nThe art market is where buyers and sellers of art transact with each other. It is a unique market because it uses a complex system to set art prices based on prediction on future values of art and cultural value. (Plattner, 1998) Additionally, many art market transactions are done privately. (Coslor, 2016"

"\n\nIt takes several experts and clients to run the art market smoothly. Here are the key actors within the art market"

"\n\n\n\nArt Administrators or Managers - Administrators or managers are the ones responsible for the efficient allocation of resources to produce art. They decide what projects should be prioritized and how much resources can be dedicated to selected projects. Their tasks include time management, human resource management, budget management, and marketing management. (International Studies in History and Business of Art & Culture, n.d.) For example, an art administrator develops a plan for an art exhibit, which includes the needed personnel, materials, and knowledge to produce the exhibit. Managers are responsible for keeping things running smoothly in art events, such as what is advertised in the poster below."
"\n\nCurators - A curator is an expert in the art that is being managed. He/She facilitates the research and sharing of relevant information that contextualize an art piece. In art administration, a curator advises the management on how to present an artwork so that it will be appreciated by the audience. (Morrissey & Satwicz, 2011) The role of the curator is applicable to traditional arts, media arts, and technological arts. The inscription below the pots in a Philippine museum shows the work of curators."

"\n\nArt Buyers - These are people who buy art and often do so based on their personal taste and for a personal function. find and purchase artwork to suit their distinguished taste. A buyer is well-versed in all types of art, techniques, and development processes; keeps up to date on art theory and criticism; and uses this knowledge to evaluate the quality and worth of a piece of art within an economic framework."

"\n\nCollectors - Collectors are involved in the art market and have generally important artistic knowledge. They specialize in specific sectors. Collections typically hold pieces of artwork from an individual artist, particular school or art, art theme, or period. The photo below shows the Kublai (Filipino artist) art collection in Ponce Suites in Davao City."

"Art Dealers - Art dealers buy artwork from artists or artists' agents and sell them to buyers or collectors. They forge good relationships with artists to represent and with collectors and museums whose interests are likely to match the work of the represented artists. Art dealers are usually the first persons to bring new artwork to the public arena. (The Art Gallery, 1971) The photo below is of a street art dealer talking to possible collectors or buyers."

"\n\nTalent Agents - Talent agents work similarly to art dealers: they bring to the public the work of the artist. Sometimes they bridge artists to funders who can give resources and money to write books, make a musical album, make a film, or make a collection of paintings."

"In conclusion, both artists and artisans produce artistic pieces. However, they differ in the medium they use and in the purpose of making their art. At times, we find it challenging to categorize an artistic person as an artist or an artisan, like in the case of Whang-od. However, we have learned in this module that different people in social communities and art markets can play a role in promoting the work of artists and artisans.\n\n"<<endl;
