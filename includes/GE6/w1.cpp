cout<<"Art History"
"\n\nArt history is studying art objects within their era period (IESA International, n.d.). Contrary to popular thoughts, it does not mean listing all the art movements and placing them on a timeline. Instead, art history involves analyzing visual art's meaning (painting, sculpture, architecture) in the context of the period when they were created."
"\n\nAccording to Britannica Encyclopedia, art history or art historiography is the historical study of the visual arts. It is mainly involved with \"identifying, classifying, describing, evaluating, interpreting, and understanding the art products and historical development of different kinds of art\"."

"\n\n\nArt Appreciation"
"\n\nThe term \"art appreciation\" refers to the knowledge of general and everlasting qualities that classify all great arts. It refers to the exploration of visual art forms or the introduction of basic principles of visual literacy. It also includes interpretation without reference to the subject matter, symbolism, or historical context. Moreover, art history relates to analyzing a particular artwork for general audiences to enhance their enjoyment of such works of art."

"\n\nArt appreciation can be subjective. It can depend on personal preferences for aesthetics and form or based on several elements and principles of design, depending on social and cultural acceptance."

"\n\n\nNature of Art"
"\n\nArt is used in many ways. It covers various areas of artistic creativity that seek to communicate beauty primarily through the senses. It embraces the visual arts (e.g., painting, sculpture, architecture, and graphic arts), auditory arts, and performing arts (e.g., music, dance, theater, opera, and cinema)."

"\n\nIn a specific sense, art applies to activities that express aesthetic ideas using skill and imagination to create objects, environments, and experiences shared with others. Beardsley (1981) pointed out that artists produce artwork to give, referring to the capacity to satisfy the aesthetic interest. The word \"intention\" in art means a combination of desire and belief to produce any work that captivates aesthetic interest." 

"\n\nAnything accomplished with remarkable skills is art. Art may serve as an exercise in skill and manual dexterity. The artists' works can be examined as a result of a skilled manipulation of materials."

"For example, these specialized arts may include the art of teaching and the art of acupuncture. Specialized art may also comprise speaking art, sartorial art, culinary art, carpentry, pottery making, ceramics making, and metallurgy art. Art is present in almost all human activities- even in modern technology, the phrase \"state of the art\" means superior or technically perfect artistry."

"\n\nWhen we speak of art, we must not be deceived into believing that the term corresponds to some natural, objective, and fixed body of works. The category of art is made to operate merely as a "

"descriptive rubric. Instead, we must understand it as a concept- not as a natural, preordained creation but as an academic instruction or criteria for a defined set of topics felt to be of exceptional value."

"\n\n\nCreativity, Imagination, and Expression"
"\n\nCreativity focuses on the process of forming original ideas through exploration and discovery."

"\n\nAccording to Albert Einstein, imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination personifies the world."

"\n\nAccording to Robin George Collingwood, expression is what an artist does to emotion. The artist discovers their own feelings and creates something beautiful out of them simultaneously through expression."
		
"\n\n\nAssumptions (and Theories) of Art"
"\n\nArt is Universal"
"\n\nArt is universal and timeless, spanning generations and continents thoroughly. It transcends cultures, conditions, or situations. Some works of art that were created long ago are still famous today."

"\n\nThey are widely accepted by different worldwide people worldwide despite their different geographies, beliefs, and cultures. This phenomenon shows that an actual work of art stands out regardless of any circumstance."

"\n\nIn appreciating the beauty of art, age is never a factor to determine if an object is an actual work of art. It is a popular misconception that artworks need to be old and dated before they can be recognized as art. This belief about art is not valid. According to Dudley (1960), \"Art is not good because it is old, but it is old because it is beautiful.\" Age is not a factor; instead, the art's art quality is what makes it stand out through time."

"\n\n\nArt imitates life and reality."
"\n\nArt is born in experience; it is the footprint or fingerprint of the artist's experience of reality. Since artists live in a given time, place, and culture, their artworks are statements that probe the concepts of life and reality during their time."

"\n\n\nArt has intrinsic worth: The value is in itself"

"\n\nHumanities are generally regarded as the areas in which human values, expressiveness, and creativity are celebrated. Every creative work of art enhances the value of life in total. Although art can be used similarly to spiritual values, it cannot be used identical to spiritual values so that it cannot be used up or exhausted. A great masterpiece of art is never out of date, and they tend to magnify their value through the ages to come."

"\n\n\nArt is Imitation"
"\n\nThe concept of arts as imitation may be traced back to two renowned Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle. Plato, the idealist, believes that art is far removed from reality, which exists in the realm of ideas or universals. Our world is but an imperfect imitation; art is, in turn, only an imitation in our world. He places art on the same level as shadow and water reflections, all mere illusions of reality."

"\n\nAristotle, an empiricist, rejected the belief in the realm of ideas. Instead, he believed that reality exists right in the world, around us, and within us, as our senses perceive. Art is a mirror of reality; therefore, it brings us in contact with it."

"\n\n\nArt is Pleasure"
"\n\nNeither Plato nor Aristotle ignored the role of pleasure in art. On the contrary, they both believed that art gave pleasure by representing the physical world. Aristotle, in his Nicomachean ethics, explained the connection between imitation, learning, and pleasure. Imitation is natural to humans from childhood. One of the advantages of men over lower animals is that man is the most imitative creature globally and learns first by imitation."

"\n\nThe truth of this point is shown by experience. However, although the objects themselves may be painful to see, we delight in viewing the most realistic representations of them in art. The idea is that imitative and pleasurable qualities go together. However, this phenomenon does not indicate that what is not imitative will not give pleasure."

"\n\n\nArt is a Play"
"\n\nLike artists, everybody needs a break from routine and drudgery; we need an outlet to vent our passions, emotions, and other forms of uncontrolled expression of energy. Artists find this in art; they feel it indirectly through their expression of their craft."

"\n\n\nArt is Expression"
"\n\nOur reactions to art depend on two related assumptions. First, artists express their emotions. Second, the expression is one of the sources of aesthetic value. However, art as an expression is concerned with the relationship between the artist and their work of art."

"\n\nArt is also concerned with the relationships between the artist's work of art and its audience."

"\n\nThe expression has been taken to mean different things by various writers. While some have concentrated on the artist's creative process- others have stressed evoking the audience's emotion.\n\n"<<endl;
