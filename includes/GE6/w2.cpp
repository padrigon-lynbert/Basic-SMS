cout<<"Philosophies of Art"
"\n\nPhilosophy of art is the study of the nature of art, including interpretation, representation, expression, and form that is closely related to aesthetics, which is the philosophical study of beauty and taste. Several philosophies of art are listed as follows:"

"\n\n\nArt as Imitation"

"\n\nArt as imitation came from the Greek Philosopher Plato. In his book, “Republic,” he considered artists as imitators and art as a mere imitation of what is in the reality. Plato disagreed with the inclusion of art in the curriculum because it highly affects human reasoning. For Plato, the true real world is the world of forms or the eternal world. He believed that everything on earth is only an imperfect copy of what is in the world of forms. Thus, whatever the artist is doing is already an imitation, and art=making is considered to be a work of imitation. For example, a chair that one sits on is not a perfect chair, but it is only an imperfect copy of a perfect chair in the world of forms. For Plato, the artist reinforces the belief in copies and prevents people to reach the true entities in the world of forms."

"\n\n\nArt as Representation"

"\n\nThis view of art came from Aristotle. According to him, all arts have their techniques and rational principles, and the artist/craftsman brings his conceptions through mastery. Arts do copy nature, but their representations are fuller and more meaningful than what nature gives us. This factor is the strength of art. Therefore, we do not need to insist on some moral purpose for art, which is free to represent all manner of things present, past, imagined, or institutionally required. Aristotle believed that art is not a copy of a copy but a version of possible realities. Different from Plato, Aristotle believed that art will help people for the fundamental realities of the world. According to Aristotle, art has two purposes, as follows: art allows us to experience pleasure, and art can teach people and lead them to reflect on life."

"\n\n\nArt for Art’s Sake"

"\n\nA slogan translated from the French word that was coined in the early 19th century by French Philosopher Victor Cousin. The phrase expresses the belief held by many writers and artists, especially those associated with aestheticism, that art needs no justification, and it needs to serve no political, didactic, or another end. This philosophy sees beauty as something subjective, that is, an artist works for the sake of beauty according to his definition or preference of beauty. A good example of it is that on the slide. It a work of Marcel Duchamp in 1917 entitled “Fountain.” Duchamp believed that an artwork should be judged separately from the other sphere of life, such as morality.";
