cout<<"Subject of Art"
"\n\nThe subject is a recognizable part of art because it is easily depicted by our senses. It is the visual focus of the image that may be extracted from examining the artwork. Subject pertains to the “what” of an artwork. For example, when you look at an image, you will be able to recognize the subject that the presence of a father, a mother, and children; hence, you may say that the image consists of a family, or you look at a painting and see that it is a painting of an apple. What exactly is depicted in the image is the subject itself."

"\n\nConcerning the subject matter, art is an imitation, depiction, or representation of an aspect of the nature of life. The object that is being imitated, depicted, or represented in art is its subject matter. Anything in the universe, such as the aspect of nature including the sea, the sky, fields, forest, mountains, animals, etc. (often depicted in painting); human concern in the realm of experience, action, and deed (as recounted in fiction, narrative poetry, and drama); emotions and moods (lyric poetry); ideas (the essay); spatial forms (i.e., sculpture and architecture); tonal forms (music); and plastic forms in motion, space, and time (dance), may serve as the subject of art."

"\n\n\"Subject\" is a term used for whatever is represented in a work of art. It refers to any identifiable object, individual, thing, place, or event that is illustrated in a work of art. The subject answers the question of what is it or what it is about. However, not all artworks have a subject. Art with a subject is called objective or representational art, while that without a subject is called nonobjective or nonrepresentational art. According to the subject matter, art may be classified into two types, as follows:"

"\n\nRepresentational or Objective Art - It portrays or depicts something other than its form. Representational art or figurative art represents objects or events in the real world, usually looking easily recognizable. This type is also referred to as figurative art. Take a painting of a bird, a sculpture of a person, or a drawing of a flower as examples. They can be easily recognized because they represent what is existing in this world. Representational art is the type of art that we see the most. It is the use of signs that stand in for and take the place of something else. Representational means descriptive, figurative, and symbolized. Briefly, it depicts something easily recognized by most people."

"\n\nNonrepresentational or Nonobjective Art - Nonobjective art represents except its form. If representational art is a picture of something, then nonrepresentational art is the complete opposite. Instead of directly portraying something recognizable, the artist will use form, shape, and color, and line, which are essential elements in visual art, to express emotion, feeling, or other concepts. It is also called “complete abstraction” or nonfigurative art. Nonrepresentational and abstract arts are not exact things. There is no clear-cut divide, but they exist in the spectrum. When artists work on abstraction, they are distorting the view of a known thing, a person, or a place."


"\n\n\nSources and Kinds of Subject of Art"
"\n\nNature - The natural environment has always been the source and popular subjects used by the artist. The painter’s observation of and communion with nature is always a convenient and ever available subject throughout the ages. Van Gogh’s Starry Night is a good example."
"\n\nAnimals - Most primitive paintings and sculpture are about animals. Either the graceful movements or the brute strength of certain animals continued to attract and inspire painters and sculptors. Albrecht Durer’s The Rhinoceros is an example."
"\n\nHistory - Traditionally, historical figures such as rulers, statesmen, leaders, and heroes were always good subjects for writers, painters, and sculptors. Throughout the ages, sculptors carved the bust or figures of great men, and many painters drew the portraits of outstanding leaders to show their admiration and respect. The statue of Augustus Caesar in the Vatican Museum, Rome is an example."
"\n\nMythology, Legend, and Folklore - Religious and mythical characters are also the favorite subjects of many artists. The sacred, sublime, and supernatural character of religion and ancient mythology helps the artist create a sense of awe, intrigue, and inspiration, which is manifested in his work. The Christian religion had tremendous influences on artists belonging to the medieval period. The Medieval masterpieces of art were subjects include Christ, Madonna and Child, and stories from the New and Old Testaments. These artworks reflected the power of the Church on European society during the early Middle Ages. Legendary figures and folk heroes are also good subjects for artists. Literary epic writers heralded the exploits of legendary figures, such as those of King Arthur. In our case, we have the epics of Biag ni Lam-ang, Bernardo Carpio, etc. The exploits of folk heroes, whether part-history or pure fiction, such as Robin Hood, William Wallace, Sinbad the Sailor, and Darna, are celebrated by artists in either print or cinema."
"\n\nEveryday Life – Several artists make as subjects people doing ordinary activities. They have created these activities in painting. Examples are Planting Rice and Laundry Woman by Fernando Amorsolo."



"\n\n\nContent in Art"
"\n\nContent is the meaning that is communicated in an artwork. Content is not the subject or things in the painting. Content is the communication of ideas, feelings, and reactions that are connected with the subject. When we look at a painting, its content is what is sensed instead of what can be analyzed. Content is the ultimate reason for creating art. Something in the painting must appeal or speak to the heart, spirit, and soul of the viewer, which is called emotional content; it is the “why” of any artwork. Form is the development and configuration of an artwork, that is, the process it has been through until it becomes a visible work of art; it is the “how” of any artwork. Form answers the question of how the artist uses the medium and techniques to come up with an artwork."

"\n\nThere are three levels in the meaning of the content of art:"

"\n\nFactual - The literal statement or the narrative content in the work that can be directly apprehended because the objects presented are easily recognized."

"\n\nConventional – It refers to the special meaning that a certain object or color has a particular culture or group of people."

"\n\nSubjective – Any personal meaning consciously or unconsciously conveyed by the artist by using a private symbolism that stems from his association of certain objects, actions, or colors with past experiences.\n\n"<<endl;
