cout<<"Elements of Art"
"\n\nArt is a powerful language. Artists communicate thoughts, ideas, and emotions through art. Similar to languages, the language of art has its vocabulary and is not made up of words; instead, it is made up of visual, auditory, and tactile elements. The visual elements are color, line, shape, form, space, and texture."

"\n\nThe medium is the physical medium via which we can interact with a work of art, whereas the elements are the traits or properties of that work of art. The medium is tangible, while the elements are abstract."

"\n\n'nThe elements of art are the following:"

"\n\n\n1. Color - It is harder to see colors when the light is dim. Color relies on light. Color refers to the hue and value, which means the amount of white or black in the hue and intensity or brightness."

"\n\n\nCharacteristics of Color"

         "\n\n\t1. Hue - Hue is the name of a color, such as red, blue, or yellow. Hue is the dimension of color, which refers to a scale ranging."
            "\n\t\tthrough red, yellow, green, and blue."
            "\n\t\tPrimary Colors – red, blue, and yellow"
            "\n\t\tSecondary Colors – violet, green, and orange"
            "\n\t\tComplementary Colors – those that are opposite in the scale"
            "\n\t\tIntermediate Colors – those that are adjacent to each other in the wheel"


"\n\n\n2. Value - Value is the lightness or darkness of a color. It can be changed by adding black or white. Color is the name given to the relative degrees of light and dark."


"\n\nScale of Medium - White, light, medium, and dark sources of values, that is, the object itself (local color), the creation of value through shadows or reflection of light, and the intensity or saturation (the brightness or darkness of a hue)."


"\n\nColor Schemes - Colors can be combined to produce many interesting and exciting results. Artists use different types of color schemes to create various effects. The following are examples of the color schemes:"

        "\n\nMonochromatic - This scheme uses different values of a single hue, such as dark green, medium green, and light green."

        "\n\nAnalogous - Colors are side by side in the color wheel and share a hue."

        "\n\nWarm or Cool Color Scheme - Warm color schemes with red, yellow, and orange colors project the sun and its warmth. Artists use blue, green, and violet, that is, a cool color scheme, to make the preceptors/viewers think of cool items, such as ice or grass."

"\n\n\nWays of Using Color"

"\n\nRepresentational Use - The artist paints objects from the real world in hues approximating the colors that are present in ordinary illumination, thereby indicating color constancy in the color of the objects."

"\n\nImpressionist Use - It rejects the use of painting or colors in the local order; instead, it seeks to render nature with a sensitive perception of the effects of changing conditions of lights on objects."

"\n\nDecorative or Ornamental Use - This is related to pattern and design in which colors appear as design components to enhance rhythm and sensuous appeal."

"\n\nPersonal Use - Artist uses hues to express his feelings and emotions and their spontaneous impulses and whims."

"\n\nScientific Use - This refers to using a consistent format of a colored square of a different hue."

"\n\nSymbolic Use - The meaning of colors changes from one culture to another and may also vary from one period to another."



"\n\n\n\n2. Line - A line as an element of art is defined as the path of a moving point through space. Line is the simplest, most primitive, and most universal means for creating visual arts. Line is defined as the shape of the artwork."
 
"\n\nKinds of Lines"

"\n\nHorizontal Lines - They run parallel to the ground and appear to be at rest projecting a sense of quiet relationship and contemplation. Long horizontal lines give a sense of infinity that is difficult to obtain in any other way."

"\n\nVertical Lines - Vertical lines are associated with the body in an upright standing position and generally express poise, alertness, equilibrium, firmness, strength and it connotes a static position though not without tension."

"\n\nDiagonal Lines - The diagonal line is associated with the body forward and charging purposefully towards an objective. It signifies energy, dynamism, impulse, will power, aspiration, and passion, as well as emotion."

"\n\nCurved Lines - Curved lines show action, life, and energy. They suggest grace and beauty with the body in movements that create a rhythm of curved lines in space. Curved lines are allied to feelings, impulse, spontaneity, play graces, charm eroticism and sensuality."

"\n\nZigzag Lines - Lines, which are made from combined diagonal lines, can create confusion or suggest action."



"\n\n\n\n3. Shape - A shape is an art element that refers to a region defined by one or more other art elements. A shape can only have two dimensions: length and width."

"\n\nKinds of Shapes"

"\n\nGeometric Shape - They are to be made with a ruler or drawing tool. Square, circle, triangle, rectangle, and oval are the five geometric shapes."

"\n\nOrganic - They are also called free form. Organic shapes aren't even or regular. Their contours might be curved, angular, or a combination of the two."
		
		

"\n\n\n4. Form - Like shapes, forms have length and width, art also has third-dimension depth and this is called form. With forms found in the works of art, such as sculpture, one can experience the three dimensions by walking around or perceive directly through these artworks."



"\n\n\n5. Space - refers to the distance between around, above, and within things. The positive area refers to the shapes or forms in both two and three-dimensional works of art. Negative areas on the other hand are the empty spaces between the shapes. The relationship between the positive and the negative spaces will affect how the artwork can be interpreted. "



"\n\n\n6. Texture - You can feel the texture of your desk or worktable by running your finger over the top of it. The way things feel or appear to feel when touched is referred to as texture."

"\n\nTypes of Texture"

"\n\nOptical Texture - An artist can create a color illusion with his skillful painting style."

"\n\nPhysical texture - an artist might utilize powerful brushstrokes to convey the artist's and his subject's physical and emotional strength."

"\n\nEphemeral Texture - This is the third group of textures whose transient shapes, including clouds, dust, fire, bubbles, and liquids, are subject to shift."



"\n\n\nPrinciples of Design"

"\n\nThe guidelines that a designer must follow in order to create an effective and appealing composition are known as design principles. "

"\n\nEmphasis - Make a mental outline of everything you want to do. Allow your brain to organize the data before laying up your design in a way that conveys that order. If the band's name is the most important piece of information, put it in the middle or make it the poster's largest feature; you can also place it in the strongest, boldest type. Similar to writing without an outline or building without a blueprint, if you start your composition without an idea of what you are trying to communicate, then your design will not succeed."
"\n\nBalance and Alignment - A weight is assigned to each element on a page. Color, size, and texture can all contribute to weight. You wouldn't put all of your furniture in one corner of a room, and you shouldn't put all of your heavy pieces in one region of your composition. Equally weighted items located on both sides of a centerline generate balance in symmetrical design. Asymmetrical design, on the other hand, employs opposing weights to produce an uneven yet balanced composition. Symmetrical patterns are always pleasing, if a little dull at times. Asymmetrical designs are bold and can give your composition a lot of visual appeal and movement."
"\n\nContrast - Contrast is what people mean when they say a design “pops.” It comes away from the page and sticks in your memory. Contrast creates space and difference between elements in your design. Your background needs to be significantly different from the color of your elements for them to work harmoniously together and are readable."
"\n\nRepetition - A design's repetition unites and strengthens it. If only one thing on your band's poster is written in blue italic sans-serif, it could be interpreted as a mistake. You've built a motif and regained control of your design if three things are in blue italic sans-serif. Repetition is vital for more than just one printed product. Beautiful graphic patterns are a big part of today's packaging design."
"\n\nProportion - The apparent size and weight of parts in a composition, as well as how they relate to one another, is referred to as proportion. It is generally more effective to approach your design in portions rather than as a whole."
"\n\nMovement - The elements in a composition are controlled by movement. As a result, the eye is drawn from one to the next, and the information is effectively conveyed to your audience."
"\n\nWhite Space - White space (or negative space) is the only one that specifically deals with what you do not add. White space is the empty page around the elements in your composition. For beginning designers, white space can be a perilous zone. Giving a composition room to breathe can often upgrade it from mediocre to successful. White space creates hierarchy and organization. Our brains naturally associate ample white space around an element with importance and luxury. It is telling our eyes that objects in one region are grouped separately from objects elsewhere."


"\n\n\nPrinciples of Art"

"\n\nBalance - Balance is concerned with arranging elements to ensure that no one part of a work overpowers or outweighs any other part. In art, balance is either seen or felt by the viewer."

"\n\nKinds of Balance"

"\n\nFormal Balance - This refers to symmetrical balances between the two halves that are mirror images."
"\n\nInformal Balance - This refers to asymmetrical balances two dissimilar elements that seem to carry equal weight. "
"\n\nVariety - Routine activity day after day can become dull and boring. The same color or shapes repeated over and over in an artwork can make an artwork dull as well. To avoid this, artists use variety concerned with combining one or more elements to create interest by adding slight changes. "

"\n\nHarmony - If limited variety can become dull and boring, then excessive variety can also create disorder and chaos. Artists avoid such predicaments in their works by using the principle of harmony. Harmony is a principle of art that is concerned with blending elements to create a calm and restful appearance."

"\n\nEmphasis - To attract and gain the viewer’s attention to significant aspects of an artwork, artists use the principle of emphasis. The power of emphasis makes an element in a work stand out. It can be created by contrast or by extreme changes in an element."

"\n\nProportion - Proportion is a principle of art that is concerned with the relationship of one part to another and the whole. Elements, just like color, can be used in differing proportions to create emphasis."

"\n\nMovement - Artists use the principle of movement to lead the viewer’s eyes throughout the work. Movement is the principle of art used to create the look and feel of action and guide a viewer’s eye through the work of art. It encourages the viewer to scan, visualize, and probe the artwork."

"\n\nRhythm - Artists make use of the principle of rhythm, which is a principle of art that is concerned with repeating elements to make a work seem active or to elicit vibration. To create rhythm, an artist can repeat the element and the same objects over and over.\n\n"<<endl;
