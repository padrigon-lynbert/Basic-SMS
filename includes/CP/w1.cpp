cout<<"What is C++?"

	"\n\n\tC++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications."
	
	"\n\n\tC++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language."
 	
	"\n\n\tC++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory."

"\n\nThe language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17."

"\n\n\nWhy Use C++"

"\n\nC++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages."

"\n\nC++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems."

"\n\nC++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs."

"\n\nC++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms."

"\n\nC++ is fun and easy to learn!"

"\n\nAs C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa."


"\n\n\nC++ Get Started"
"\n\nTo start using C++, you need two things:"

"\n\nA text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code"

"\n\nA compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand"

 
"\n\n\nThere are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below)."

"\n\nC++ Quickstart"

"\n\nLet's create our first C++ file."

"\n\nOpen Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File."

"\n\nWrite the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File > Save File as):"

"\n\n\nmyfirstprogram.cpp"

"\n\n#include <iostream>"
"\n\nusing namespace std;"

"\n\nint main() {"
  "\n\tcout << \"Hello World!\";"
  "\n\n\treturn 0;"
"\n}"

"\n\nDon't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code."

"\n\nCongratulations! You have now written and executed your first C++ program.\n\n"<<endl;
