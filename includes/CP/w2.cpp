cout<<"1. C++ int"

"\n\nThe int keyword is used to indicate integers."
"\nIts size is usually 4 bytes. Meaning, it can store values from -2147483648 to 214748647."
"\n\nFor example, int salary = 85000;"


"\n\n\n2. C++ float and double"

"\n\nfloat and double are used to store floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials)."

"\n\nThe size of float is 4 bytes and the size of double is 8 bytes. Hence, double has two times the precision of float. To learn more, visit C++ float and double."


"\n\n\n3. C++ char"

"\n\nKeyword char is used for characters, ts size is 1 byte."

"\n\nCharacters in C++ are enclosed inside single quotes ' '."


"\n\n\nC++ Type Modifiers"

"\n\nWe can further modify some of the fundamental data types by using type modifiers. There are 4 type modifiers in C++. They are:"

"\n\n\tsigned, unsigned, short, long"

"\n\nWe can modify the following data types with the above modifiers:"
	
	"\n\n\tint, double, char"
	

"\n\n\nC++ Operators"

"\n\nIn this tutorial, we will learn about the different types of operators in C++ with the help of examples. In programming, an operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable."

"\n\nOperators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. For example, + is an operator used for addition, while - is an operator used for subtraction."

"\n\nOperators in C++ can be classified into 6 types:"

"\n\n\tArithmetic Operators, Relational Operators, Logical Operators\n\n"<<endl;
