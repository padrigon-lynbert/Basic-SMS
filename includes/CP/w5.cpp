"\n\nIn this topic, we will learn about the C++ for loop and how it works with the help of some examples."

"\n\nIn computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code."

"\n\nfor example, let's say we want to show a message 100 times. Then instead of writing the print statement 100 times, we can use a loop.:"

"\n\nThat was just a simple example; we can achieve more efficiency and sophistication in our programs by making effective use of loops."

"\n\nThere are 3 types of loops in C++."

"\n\n\tfor loop, while loop, do...while loop"

"\n\nThis tutorial focuses on C++ for loop. We will learn about the other type of loops in the upcoming tutorials."


"\n\n\nC++ for loop"

"\n\nThe syntax of for-loop is:"

"\nfor (initialization; condition; update) {"

    "\n\n\t// body of-loop"
"\n}"

"\n\nHere,"

	"\n\n\tinitialization - initializes variables and is executed only once"
	"\n\tcondition - if true, the body of for loop is executed"
	"\n\tif false, the for loop is terminated"

	"\n\n\tupdate - updates the value of initialized variables and again checks the condition"
	
	
"\n\n\nC++ while and do...while Loop"

"\n\nIn this tutorial, we will learn the use of while and do...while loops in C++ programming with the help of some examples."

"\n\nThere are 3 types of loops in C++."

"\n\n\tfor loop, while loop, do...while loop"

"\n\n\nC++ while Loop"
