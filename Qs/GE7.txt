The Late Middle Ages - Scholasticism and the Scientific Method
As thinkers continued the work of scholasticism, adding to the philosophy underpinning science, the Late Middle Ages (from 1300 until 1500) saw progress speed up. This period made sophisticated observations and theories that were sadly superseded by works of later scientists. Finally, the removal of divine intervention from the process of explaining natural phenomena was sought out by many of the scholastic philosophers. They believed that scholars should look for a more direct and natural cause rather than stating that it must be the work of divine providence.

The Black Death - The Destroyer of Medieval Society and Scholasticism
In favor of the later thinkers that drove the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment, the advances of many of these philosophers and scholars were forgotten and underplayed. The first Renaissance of the Middle Ages was halted by a natural phenomenon, the Black Death. This phenomenon killed over a third of Europeans, especially in the growing urban areas.

It is the mass disruption to medieval society, which was caused by the plague, that set the progress of science and discovery back. These knowledge would not reemerge until the Renaissance.
